i am sorry to say , however , that peace and justice are not such key issues .
the european constitution talks about promoting peace but it does not accept that rejecting war and negotiating solutions to conflicts are fundamental .
in recent years , the un has been devalued , partly at least by the military policy of a fundamentalist president of a country that still practices the death penalty in many of its states and that rejects international organisations , not least the international criminal court .
war has become legitimate again ; militarism is permeating hearts and minds .
i do not underestimate the important commitment made by mr laschet and all the members of the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy .
together with the message sent out by awarding the sakharov prize to kofi annan , it is a clear message designed to restore value to the european union and the united nations and to once again give them a role . it is , however , essential that security for everyone , the reduction of poverty and the promotion of justice and peace are genuine practices and not just empty promises .
the un and the european union , together with other countries , must re-establish trust and , above all , respect for international law .
mr president , i must thank my colleague mr laschet for this report , which is far-reaching and envisages great opportunities , but we must also devise a way to move from the current situation towards realising these opportunities .
i feel that the proposal made by mr laschet represents the first phase of a reform that the un must , however , face up to .
having left behind the rationale of yalta and power blocs , we must make the case for increasing multilateralism .
we must make new nations responsible at world level , without removing time-honoured instruments through which world peace has been promoted ; and the right of veto is one such time-honoured instrument .
the security council must , in any case , be enlarged , and we then need to consider new permanent members , without the right of veto .
these could include the european union , australia , argentina , brazil , egypt , germany , japan , india , italy and south africa .
furthermore , we also need to expand the number of members elected to the security council and then reform the agencies to make them more operational on the ground . we need to speed up the promotion of human rights and the affirmation of the principles of democracy .
we need to assume that the united nations intends to protect people , since it invokes the concept of the nation and not that of the state , and the concept of the nation presupposes the protection of the person .
this process of protecting people needs to start as a matter of urgency because terrorism is hot on our heels : today it is in the guise of <unk> bin laden , tomorrow it could have a different name .
of course , a reformed nato could be the international police force that the un might need .
division and exclusion certainly give rise to war ; union and the philosophical concept of union instead promote important goals of peace .
mr president , let me begin with three personal recollections .
i was privileged to address the un working group in geneva on indigenous peoples and thus witnessed how it forms a world parliament for some of the most oppressed minorities anywhere in our world .
i was privileged also to represent parliament in east timor , where i witnessed at first hand sergio vieira de mello ’s successful efforts in rebuilding a whole country – a talent so tragically lost to us .
this is why i attend meetings of united nations associations in my east of england constituency , where the role and ideals of the un are cherished at a very local level .
the united nations inspires me and all of us here in europe .
it is why europe rightly champions un policies : the 0.0 % target in the millennium goals within eu development policy , and europe providing over half of all support to the un high commission for refugees , which stands up for fundamental rights as a bulwark against the racism and xenophobia now sweeping our continent .
this is why we back un reform that will secure greater efficiency and also inject new vision .
other policies championed by the eu are the un convention on disability , the move beyond the global compact towards a binding treaty on corporate accountability and the idea of an economic security council to oversee the bretton woods institutions .
finally , i am concerned that some of the proposals for changes in the veto system , the composition of the security council , or suggestions for an eu mandate prejudge the outcome of the intergovernmental conference and may not carry support in all of our countries .
despite these concerns , where we have differences in europe , most notably recently over iraq , these concern how best to uphold the authority of the un .
that authority is once again reaffirmed in mr laschet ’s report and in our vote here this morning .
mr president , following the second world war , there were high hopes that a worldwide organisation would give the world lasting peace and provide people with freedom and democracy .
these hopes were , however , dashed by the fact that the great powers often used their vetoes to block the un ’s work .
all too many member countries completely ignored the principles of the state governed by law .
following the collapse of the soviet union and the disintegration of most of the communist dictatorships in central and eastern europe , the un ’s prospects of achieving its aims have clearly improved .
in spite of this , the un has not been especially successful in getting its member countries to comply with the human freedoms and rights laid down in its charter .
in this area , the un has been too passive .
i believe that the un ’s inability to get its member countries to observe the principles concerning freedoms and rights and the state governed by law has undermined civic commitment to un matters .
there were many of us who were very surprised to note that even a representative of a dictatorship can be the chair of the un commission on human rights .
in such circumstances , it is only natural that civic commitment is instead channelled through , for example , organisations such as amnesty international .
the un now needs greater civic commitment , which would strengthen it as a worldwide organisation .
the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy adopted my proposal that it must be possible for countries that seriously and systematically violate human freedoms and rights to lose their voting rights in the un commission on human rights .
this proposal must be seen as a step in this direction , that is to say an attempt to increase people ’s confidence in the un in this area .
mr president , today is an excellent time to be debating the very good report by mr laschet on the relations between the european union and the un as , at the same time , we are receiving kofi annan , not just as a person , but as an institution , as a symbol of an irreplaceable need for the un .
the report we are debating is in essence a single proposal on relations between the european union and the un , but it is a strategic proposal for the un itself at the dawn of the twenty-first century .
the un , despite generally expressing the need for a peaceful world at its inception , reflecting the balances at the end of the second world war , is in need of some adjustment .
today circumstances are different and must be expressed .
however , until they are expressed effectively , the un is irreplaceable .
many consider that the un is the refuge of small countries which have no other way of expressing their opinions .
however , the iraqi crisis and its impasses show that the superpowers have equal need of it .
attempts at new international balances such as the enlarged g0 or the messianic <unk> perception of the various superpowers of their role lead nowhere .
proposing a strategy for the un and the european union , however , we note that we ourselves have serious gaps which we need to plug .
we recently experienced the lack of agreement in the un security council .
the enlarged european union , with the 00 members , will have the possibility to be expressed by many more members of the security council , in that it will have the possibility to be expressed by three different geographical areas of the un .
this possibility , in conjunction with the presence , which i hope will come about , of a minister of foreign affairs at the un , will provide many more possibilities .
if the new distribution does in fact result in the european union 's gaining a place on the security council , without other countries losing their place , this will allow it , from that position , to support policies for peace , cooperation , security , democracy and all the claims of mankind , which are objectives which we must attain .
mr president , i welcome mr laschet ’s report , comprehensive and ambitious though it is .
it comes at a sensitive time for both the european union and the united nations .
i want to refer in particular to the un development programme .
the report made in 0000 on the subject of arab human development was described by magazine as the most important publication of the year , and more than a million people downloaded it from the undp website .
it had particular relevance for the eu since it was the impetus for the recent commission communication – for which i am currently rapporteur – on reinvigorating human rights and democratisation with mediterranean partners .
last year ’s undp arab human development report stated that – subject to <unk> surveys – the appetite for democracy in the arab world was , at 00 % , the highest of any region in the world .
compare that , for example , with eastern europe , where the figure was 00 % .
the arab world also logged the highest rejection of authoritarian rule – the figure in this regard was 00 % – and was indeed the third highest in favour of gender equality in higher education .
so the perception that many have that the arab world is not ready for democracy is undermined by the united nations ’ own reports .
i hope , therefore , that the council and commission can , as it were , put our money where our mouth is , and redirect some of the enormous funds available for good governance , the development of civil society , democracy and the rule of law , which , in the external field – the responsibility of commissioners patten and nielson – amounts to eur 0.0 billion a year .
by contrast , the european initiative for democracy and human rights – a rather smaller fund aimed at the ex-soviet bloc – which i had the honour to set up a few years ago , amounts to only eur 000 million .
that is an indication of the distortion in spending which we need to address , and in particular the priorities with which i hope the european parliament will play some part in helping the commission in the coming years .
mr president , i wish sincerely to thank mr laschet for a well-written and important report that is politically well balanced and forward-looking .
i shall concentrate on four points .
the first concerns amendment no 0 by the group of the european people ’s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats and myself . it has also been supported by the group of the party of european socialists .
the european parliament ‘ [ c ] <unk> that the elaboration of the common foreign and security policy towards the un should be characterised by the participation and joint influence of all the european union ’s member states ’ . if we have a common foreign and security policy , it cannot be devised solely by the major powers : germany , france and perhaps also great britain .
all the member states must feel they are participating in this area .
the smaller member states must not be confronted by a , with a common foreign and security policy having come about because the larger countries have already adopted positions .
otherwise , there is no common foreign and security policy .
regarding paragraph 00 , i would , secondly , emphasise the value of depriving countries that systematically infringe human rights of their right to vote in the un commission on human rights until such breaches cease .
this must be pursued in a un context .
the third point i wish to emphasise concerns the un security council .
the eu should make better use of the two votes that eu member states , namely great britain and france , now already , in actual fact , possess in the security council .
we must not therefore weaken the eu ’s current 00 % representation in the un security council .
i should now like to address mr patten regarding amendment no 0 , also supported by the ppe-de group and the pse group .
we support costa rica ’s initiative and the un general assembly ’s decision to work on a corresponding convention in 0000 on banning human cloning .
– mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this report is splendid , and it is even more splendid that we will , in a few minutes , be able to welcome the current secretary-general of the un , kofi annan .
i would of course like to take this moment to recall that there have already been three un secretaries-general who hailed from europe : <unk> lie , dag <unk> kurt <unk> , and that europe is home to two permanent un offices , in geneva and vienna .
this means that we share responsibility to a large extent .
not only do we have claims upon each other , but we also have to take joint action and support each other .
its capacity for effective action is limited by its own faults .
the charge is laid against us that it produces more rhetoric than action , that it is ineffective and is often ignored , and that the system under which every state has a vote allows the developing world to dominate the decision-making process , in that the number of votes bears no relation to the capacity to act . ’
the same could also be said of the european union ; both of us are in need of reform .
the two of us have a great deal in common .
success is dependent on political will and the determination of the member states .
it depends on acceptance and implementation – of community law in one case , and of the united nations charter in the other .
it is dependent upon multilateral cooperation , global responsibility and upon our thinking along community-oriented lines rather than <unk> .
we can make our contribution if france and england leave the security council and the eu joins it ; we would thereby be reforming the eu and our own common foreign and security policy , and forcing through a reform of the un security council .
– mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , commissioner , the report is a positive response from parliament to the commission ’s outline of relations between the eu and the united nations .
we support this , although we would like to underline a number of specific aspects .
first of all , and certainly not in contravention of the report , we should like to emphasise the institutional reforms that are necessary .
we must be able to reform the security council .
it must be possible for africa , asia and latin america to be permanent members .
after all , it is not acceptable that only the rich and the rich countries in the world should have the final word , while two thirds of the world population live in poverty .
secondly , the veto system must be reviewed and may only be used when peace is under threat – under real threat – and in the event of aggression .
thirdly , the european union must acquire full membership in the security council and in the general assembly .
it is because we would like to see effective multilateralism that we believe it necessary that the united nations be effectively organised and enabled to take decisions effectively .
this has not always been the case in the past , and the global repercussions are tragic .
i would remind you of the ineffective mandates that are sometimes given to soldiers who have to act on behalf of the united nations in peace operations .
their mandate is so inflexible that it renders them <unk> .
i would remind you of the tragedy in rwanda , of which kofi annan recently reminded us .
fortunately , things went more smoothly in congo , but we hope that the united nations will , in future , work more transparently and , above all , more democratically .
. mr president , this morning ’s debate has made clear the parliament ’s strong interest in enhancing the european union ’s engagement with the united nations .
the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy , and in particular the rapporteur , mr laschet , are to be commended on the production of this report .
i fully subscribe to the statement in the report that ' the success of global governance , in the face of the challenges posed by growing globalisation and interdependence , can only be based on an effective and fair multilateral system unequivocally anchored in the united nations ' .
the council is firmly and formally committed to effective multilateralism in its external action .
a rules-based international order with the united nations at its heart is a central element of the european security strategy , which the european council adopted in december 0000 .
i can assure you that council , under the irish presidency , is determined to work towards a more effective collective response to today ’s threats .
we are all keenly aware that terrorism and weapons of mass destruction are threats that present serious challenges , but global stability is also threatened by endemic poverty and lack of development , as well as the scourge of hiv/aids and other infectious diseases .
these are hugely destabilising factors that will literally destroy the prospects of many countries if they are not effectively remedied .
yesterday i told secretary-general annan that , in implementing the european security strategy , the european union will work particularly closely with the un to enhance mutual cooperation on conflict prevention and crisis management .
we agreed that we would work closely on devising better planning and best-practice models for conflict prevention and post-conflict peace building .
we will base this on both our organisations ' experiences in these policy areas .
this will involve working together on the practical implementation of the joint declaration on eu-un cooperation in crisis management signed late in 0000 .
we also discussed how best to build on the successful deployment in 0000 of operation artemis in the democratic republic of the congo .
before this presidency ends we are aiming to have up to 0000 military personnel available to be deployed as an eu rapid reaction capability at the disposal of the secretary-general for crisis management operations .
mr annan is very supportive of this valuable resource becoming available as soon as possible .
i assured the secretary-general that the european union was fully behind his efforts to find – to use his words – a credible and convincing collective answer to the challenges of our time .
the union will therefore support the work of the high-level panel on threats , challenges and change .
i believe that the european union can make an important contribution to this highly relevant debate .
the presidency appreciates the enthusiastic support of the commission in this endeavour and the work presently under way .
the secretary-general has made clear his view that any changes must be a means to an end , not an end in themselves .
the united nations must show , in practical and concrete ways , that it is capable of fulfilling the first purpose laid down in the charter , which is to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace .
developing our rapid reaction capability in the coming months will be a demonstration of this union 's willingness to contribute and to assist the un in this important area of activity .
today ’s debate is timely .
given the challenges to the multilateral system that secretary-general annan has placed in the spotlight in such a determined way – including last friday at the world economic forum in davos – the central thrust of this report , which reaffirms support for a strong , reformed un at the centre of the multilateral system , is very welcome .
this confirms that the secretary-general , the council , and the commission have the support of the people ’s representatives in parliament in this endeavour .
the report clearly articulates the need for the european union to ' punch its weight ' at the united nations .
european union member states are , collectively , major financial contributors to the united nations , contributing almost 00 % of its budget .
the european union will , as the report notes , represent some 000 million people from 0 may 0000 .
the council agrees fully that the eu needs to develop a commensurate political profile .
the general thrust of the report strengthens the council in its engagement with the united nations .
i wish to assure you that one of the aims of the irish presidency is to make the eu more focused , more flexible and more responsive at the united nations .
i am determined that we will devote more effort to engaging with our international partners on these important questions , in the interests of both the un and the eu .
effective multilateralism will be a subject of discussion at all our summits with strategic partners during this presidency .
today ’s discussion has highlighted a number of varied and interesting points which reflect the scope , detail and ambition of the report .
we have read and heard many proposals , some of which can be endorsed immediately .
some others , it would be fair to say , will need to be discussed over time .
the proposal that the presidency inform the parliament of the content of the eu priorities for each un general assembly session seems an excellent idea , and the council will act on this .
the proposal for exchanges of views between high-level un officials and the committees of the parliament is also to be commended .
the question of eu representation at the united nations will certainly need to be addressed in the light of the final outcome of the negotiations on the constitution , which will confer a legal personality on the european union .
some of the issues raised are much more complex , and merit careful consideration .
i wish to commend the ambition of the report for the range of proposals that it contains concerning the activity of the parliament in relation to the various funds , programmes and agencies of the united nations .
no doubt this is work that the committee concerned and the parliament will advance over time .
i have also noted carefully what was said regarding the representation of the eu in the security council .
clearly , this is not an issue that can be easily resolved at the moment .
it must be kept under review as our common policies develop over time .
likewise , the issue of the reform of the security council is not one that can be easily resolved .
the high-level panel appointed by the secretary-general will address this question , among others .
we are all aware of the difficulties and problems encountered by advocates of institutional reform in the un .
the necessary consensus remains difficult to develop .
this , however , must not deflect us from the essential task of making the security council , and the multilateral system as a whole , more effective in meeting the challenges of today ’s world .
again , let me reiterate my appreciation of this initiative .
it has provided a stimulus for the ongoing discussion of the eu ’s support for the un and the parliament ’s role in that regard .
i can assure you that the council is firmly aware of the issues that are addressed in it , and of the issues that have been raised here today .
– thank you , mr president-in-office of the council .
the debate is closed.the vote will take place at 00.00 a.m. ( 0 )
it actually seeks to establish a ‘ stateless diplomacy ’ supported by a network of organisations over which national democracies have little control .
the declared intentions ( in essence , a commitment to multilateralism , respect for human rights , peacekeeping and nature conservation ) appear to be excellent . but how is democratic control to be exerted ?
in fact , the laschet report seeks primarily to limit the member states ’ scope for action at the un and to replace them with the european union , controlled by the european parliament , which is taking advantage of this to raise its status .
this is tantamount to saying , however , that we prefer ‘ democracies that are low on substance ’ , like the european democracy , to really meaningful national democracies .
in particular , the laschet report welcomes the reforms that the european constitution would bring if it were adopted , including specifically legal personality for the union and a european minister for foreign affairs , which would enable this programme to become a reality .
that is one further reason to reject both the constitution and the laschet report .
– yes to a more active role for the eu within the un , as recommended by the report .
‘ multilateralism ( which ) remains the best way to achieve global peace and security ’ , is indeed one way of guaranteeing that we avoid the supremacy of one superpower .
but the objectives that are set out disregard reality and current dangers .
declarations of intent are no longer enough : poverty eradication , human development , conflict prevention and peacekeeping all require a degree of financial and political investment that is equal to these challenges .
following the armed intervention and occupation of iraq by the united states and the suppression – to the point of extinction ? – of the palestinian people , the spirit that prevailed when the united nations was created and the principles underlying the charter are more than ever being ridden over roughshod and even trampled underfoot by certain countries .
now more than ever we need to defend international law and champion the right of nations to self-determination with renewed vigour and that means taking action .
the united nations peace plan for western sahara , for example , including holding a referendum on self-determination , must be implemented , regardless of any further shilly-shallying by the moroccan government .
proper sanctions must also be applied in cases where human rights are violated or the environment is damaged .
the un peace missions in east timor , sierra leone and liberia , together with the reconstruction of afghanistan , as well as the humanitarian work for children and the fight against hunger and diseases all indicate that the un continues to play an essential role in establishing peace and security .
i therefore join kofi annan in his call for a radical reform of the un .
at present , this organisation is far too bureaucratic and not in tune with the geopolitical realities of the 00st century .
the eu which , together with its member states , accounts for nearly 00 % of the un budget , should take the lead in this reform .
it is essential in this respect that the eu should be able to speak with one voice in the security council .
all credit to the eu for continuing to encourage the un to face up to its responsibilities with regard to conflict prevention and maintaining the peace .
it should not , however , be mere lip service . for hazardous operations in africa , we are forced to call upon badly equipped and unmotivated troops from bangladesh , pakistan or india .
sometimes , this creates more problems than it solves .
why can the eu as such not deploy more troops under the un flag with a un mandate ?
i therefore call for a european union which decisively takes the lead in the reform of the united nations , not only with fine declarations and symbolic contributions , but , above all , with concrete commitments and actual solidarity at the coalface .
we shall now proceed to the vote .
– mr president , i have been told by those of my colleagues who understand italian that , on paragraph 00 of the un report , you said ‘ , which apparently means ‘ rejected ’ .
that paragraph was , however , adopted by an overwhelming majority of the house , including the socialists , and we ask you to amend your lists accordingly .
mr president , it was made clear during yesterday ’s debate that there are certain parts of this report , which expressly refer to olaf , which are being removed from it on the recommendation of the legal services since they are not admissible , and these parts are therefore not being voted on .
( 0 )
– mr president , given the late hour , the fact that we are behind schedule and the difficulty that members are going to have negotiating the traffic to reach the airport , there is a danger that there will not be enough of us left to vote on the last reports on the agenda .
in agreement with the rapporteur , mr zappalà , our group proposes that the vote on this report be postponed and that it be put to the vote as the first item of voting time on the wednesday of the next strasbourg part-session .
mr president , i would request on behalf of the group of the european peoples ’ party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats and the group of the party of european socialists that , given the time , the vote be postponed until the next part-session in strasbourg .
mr president , i know that many members have very important commitments back in their constituencies and regions , and maybe even more important appointments back at the airport .
however , we have been waiting for a number of reports , especially the zappalà report , to come to the floor of this house for a reasonable period of time now .
we all have our voting lists in front of us , we were sent here to vote on these issues , so can we now get on with it ?
it seems that we are putting things off for no reason whatsoever .
– mr president , as my group ’s shadow rapporteur , i would nevertheless like further reassurance that this is only about deferring the vote , and that the agreements reached between the groups will be unaffected and will not again be rescinded .
– mr president , this part contradicts a resolution already adopted by this house on the liberal professions .
i therefore ask that it be amended along the lines we have already agreed to , so that the oral amendment would read : ‘ considers that the commission should not only take account of the market situation in applying the provisions of competition law to the liberal professions , but must also bear in mind the social aspects and tasks in the public interest .
calls therefore on the commission to allow associations of the liberal professions the discretion to take measures to permit them to perform their functions correctly . ’
– mr president , when i was a law student , my <unk> , among them my father , taught me the fundamental distinction that german philosophy draws between – the world as it should be – and – the world as it really is .
this morning , in adopting this resolution on relations between the european union and the united nations , it is quite possible that parliament has indeed perceived the world as it should be .
unfortunately , there is no doubt that the resolution does not take sufficient account of the world as it really is , for better or for worse .
in particular , it would be a loss to the world and europe if we were , without any guarantees , to relinquish the united kingdom ’s status as a permanent member and even more so if we were to relinquish that of france .
that is why i voted against .
we oppose what are termed binding international treaties governing companies ’ activities .
on this point , we cannot support the present report .
we instead recommend that companies operate in accordance with responsibly designed voluntary codes of conduct .
. – i voted against the laschet report on the draft european constitution , which has not yet been adopted , in order to highlight the brussels institutions ’ long-standing foreign policy ambitions , which involve making the european union into a fully-fledged international actor ‘ as soon as its legal personality is recognised by the constitution ’ ( paragraph 00 ) , which amounts to making it an international partner equivalent to a state and with all the characteristics of one , including even permanent membership of the un .
i might add that , to all outward appearances , today ’s ceremony resembled a mutual support pact between institutions seeking to confer legitimacy upon each other .
although the laschet report does of course steer clear of going into detail about what would become of the seats held by france and the united kingdom on the security council , it is clear that the system proposed by the report would logically result in their abolition .
whilst the draft european constitution does not declare that europe should have one single representative on the international stage , it does put in place all the legal preconditions for it .
it follows that it is grossly hypocritical to support this constitution whilst , at the same time , claiming that france will remain a permanent member of the un .
. the european parliament has adopted an own-initiative resolution on relations between the eu and the un , containing key aspects that i believe to be extremely dangerous .
this applies in particular when it views the eu as a political-military bloc , on the basis of the false assumption that the so-called ‘ european constitution ’ has already been approved and ratified .
the report even goes as far as to expand on the supranational nature of the constitution in important aspects – in some places , as a matter of fact , appearing to be totally blind to the reality of the situation .
one example of this is the position adopted by the major powers at the brussels summit .
this proposal represents a clear attack on each country ’s sovereignty in its international relations .
the resolution even takes the view that ‘ whenever an eu statement is presented on behalf of the european union or the european community , eu member states should refrain from making their national statements , which should only be envisaged on an exceptional basis and justified in advance to the eu presidency ’ .
although this resolution deals with serious issues facing humankind , it does not address them seriously and although it focuses on aspects of power , it advocates creating political and military blocs in a framework of an enhanced multilateral system , strengthening the role of the security council and attaching less priority to the role of the un general assembly .
. the european parliamentary labour party fully supports un reform , including added permanent places in the security council for the african , asian and latin american groupings .
but we differ with this resolution in relation to an eu seat and changes to the veto system .
these we believe to prejudge the outcome of the intergovernmental conference , and could risk less rather than more references to the un itself .
all of us want a strong united nations .
– the laschet report purports to be a plea for multilateralism in international relations .
it considers that the un should take centre stage in achieving this objective , with the european union playing an enhanced role within it .
but the method advocated to achieve these high-minded wishes is flawed .
for the report , a more effective un means an enlarged security council , minor restrictions on the right to veto decisions and more means of intervention , including the military option .
as with europe , an attempt is being made to embroil us in an institutional debate so that we forget the underlying problem : the fact that it is free competition above all else that determines the european union ’s policy ; the fact that the major powers assume the right to decide unilaterally what merits or does not merit economic or military intervention on the part of the un .
the fight against terrorism is thus seen as a top priority , whereas the fight against the greenhouse effect , aids or poverty is mere formality .
the un imposed sanctions on iraq , but is leaving the palestinians , chechens and so many others to their own devices .
finally , this report is written as if the european constitution had been ratified and claims that a european minister for foreign affairs will be able to represent a european consensus on international issues .
this is irresponsible .
for all of these reasons , we voted against the report .
– whenever parliament tables a report on the union ’s external policy , the federalist majority in this house cannot resist the temptation of adding points that are completely irrelevant and that , ultimately , detract from the overall work that has been done .
although we fully agree with the rapporteur on certain points , in particular on consolidating relations between the un ’s internal bodies , it is inconceivable that ‘ the participation of the european union as a full member in the security council and the general assembly of the un ’ would be accepted or , along the same lines , that ‘ the minister for foreign affairs of the european union whose functions are laid down in the draft european constitution should occupy the seat proposed … for the eu ’ .
although it is interesting to note that such proposals reveal the true nature of the federalist project , because they assume , by definition , that the union will become a state , it is also quite clear that they are the product of pure fantasy .
one single observation suffices to show how inappropriate this idea is : what would the union representative have proposed during the iraq crisis , an issue on which the union itself was split as never before ?
. the main aim of this report is to strengthen the european union ’s positions in the united nations .
it presents a set of proposals for the institutional reform of the un and reiterates the desire to develop and promote democratic values and respect for human rights .
i must , however , disagree with some of the points it makes .
firstly , we have paragraphs in which the rapporteur appears to forget the fact that no european constitution has been approved , and that all we have is a draft constitutional treaty !
next , the european union has no legal personality or minister for foreign affairs .
we are then presented with the impractical idea of enlarging the united nations security council , giving the eu a seat , without considering the more than likely opposition of the other countries that have places on the security council , or the fact that it would be hard to persuade france and the united kingdom to give up their seats .
the suggestion to abolish the simple right of veto is also entirely inappropriate .
in summary , i voted in favour of the report because of the fundamental underlying ideas , but i rejected part of recital g and items 0 , 0 , 00 , 00 , 00 and 00 .
as regards the amendments that have been tabled , one that i felt it was crucial to support is no 0 , which reiterates the idea of a universal ban on human cloning .
we have voted in favour of the proposal to amend council regulation ( ec ) no 0000/00 on financial and technical cooperation with the occupied territories ( west bank and gaza ) , but we believe that matters must be carefully followed up with a view to making it clear that appropriated eu funds will not be used for purposes other than those intended , for example for propaganda activities not designed to promote peace .
. this report is intended to support the first proposal for a regulation that has been presented on financial and technical support for the occupied territories .
this means that the few amendments that have been tabled are confined to clarifying the content of the provisions .
the report ’s aim is merely to improve and provide legal clarification of the commission text , from a technical point of view .
this is a subject area on which i believe there is broad consensus .
the aim is to provide assistance in cases of occupation , not only to states and regions , but also to local authorities , regional organisations , public agencies , local or traditional communities , organisations supporting business , private operators , cooperatives , mutual societies , associations , foundations and non-governmental organisations .
i give this proposal my unreserved support .
incidentally , at its meeting of 00 january 0000 , the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy unanimously adopted this draft legislative resolution .
i therefore voted in favour of the report .
mr president , the main issue at stake in the vote on the fava and sanders-ten holte reports on the single european sky is to adopt rules on the organisation and use of european airspace with the aim of improving the operational capabilities , safety and punctuality of the air navigation services that are provided on a daily basis to thousands of consumers , including most of the members of this parliament .
account was thus taken of the safety interests of air operations , the most important of all being : greater cooperation and technical interoperability , coordination with the military air authorities and the sovereign rights of the member states in the field of air navigation .
i could only vote in favour of this convergence of views , which enabled such broad agreement to be reached between the unions and the operators , the national authorities and the commission and between the council and the european parliament .
– i support the purpose of the single european sky , which is to improve traffic flow and air traffic management alongside air safety .
however , we find the agreement reached in conciliation on the single sky unsatisfactory in several respects .
for example , the compromise that has been reached on civil-military cooperation is problematic .
do i need to remind you that this is contrary to the principle of subsidiarity ?
military issues do not fall within the remit of the eu but of the member states , which have their own defence policies and international obligations .
the member states should be free to organise their rights over their airspace as they see fit .
as for creating and modifying functional blocks of airspace , i am delighted that this will be the responsibility of the member states concerned with eurocontrol providing technical support .
it is important that the member states retain their right to make the final decision .
let us bear in mind that the single european sky must not be detrimental to civil navigation as a public service or to the safety of european airspace .
safety must not be sacrificed to an ever increasing quest for profits .
– we are not entirely satisfied with the results of the conciliation procedure between the european parliament and the council of ministers on the single european sky .
the texts put to the vote are nothing more than compromises between a liberal philosophy and safety requirements , with no mention of the prospect of a single european sky organised and controlled by european public services .
from the outset , we have supported and reported on the action taken by the european unions , who have tirelessly defended the general interest against these moves to transform the sky into a commodity .
by mobilising their forces and working with conviction , they had the principle of the <unk> of technical services accepted and ensured that the states retained responsibility for the functional blocks of airspace .
finally , they obtained a commitment from the commission to publish a review of the directive in five years ’ time .
without these concessions from the council things would have been much worse .
however , in the light of the liberalisation of the other transport sectors , we remain very concerned about the future of public authority control over this sector , which is subject to fierce competition .
moreover , the agreement leaves the member states free to decide whether to entrust air traffic control to a public service or a private company .
because of these concerns , we did not vote in favour of the results of the conciliation procedure .
. whilst i fully agree with the aims of the proposals we are now looking at , which are to reduce delays in european air transport through the more efficient use of member states ’ airspace and to maintain high levels of safety , i do have concerns that i have always voiced about the content of these proposals .
in this context i wish to refer to three crucial points in the agreement that has just been concluded : the decision that functional blocks will fall within the exclusive competence of the member states , which cannot be changed by the european union , the recognition that more efficient use of airspace depends on closer cooperation between civil and military organisations and the right of each member state to have total freedom in appointing the service provider , under the auspices of the national supervisory authorities and without having to defer to any other body .
. i voted in favour because i believe that implementing an effective common policy for air transport needs to be strengthened by current safety standards and the overall efficiency of air traffic in europe in general .
in fact , without any real guarantees for the regularity and security of air transport services at european level , there will be no genuinely free movement of goods , people and services as enshrined in the treaties .
capacities must be improved so that they meet the needs of all airspace users and flight delays must be minimised .
these points further justify my position .
i welcome the realism that marks the joint text , because it finally provides some real progress from the commission ’s initial proposals , which placed excessive limits on the sovereign power of states over their airspace and led to some confusion between issues relating to the common transport policy and those of a military nature .
on this matter , prudence dictates that national competences should be respected unreservedly , as should the international agreements that govern them , leaving any closer cooperation to the member states ’ discretion and supervision .
i therefore believe we would be justified in adopting safeguards that will enable each member state to implement the necessary measures to protect key interests in the field of security and defence policy .
. the proposal reached in conciliation answers some of the concerns we raised at the beginning of the process , such as that of sovereignty over airspace , since it was laid down that functional blocks will be defined by agreement between member states .
in the event of a dispute , states will be able to appeal to the single sky committee , and abide by its opinion , although the report could have gone further in clarifying the rules and principles that must be taken into account .
at the military level , consideration was given to the need for closer cooperation between civil and military authorities whilst respecting national competences .
portugal ’s control over the santa maria flight information region ( conferred by the international civil aviation organisation ) was also safeguarded .
it was also determined that the provision of air traffic services is related to the exercise of public authority prerogatives not of an economic nature , justifying the application of the competition rules as set out in the treaty and that each member state can , within its own airspace , appoint the service provider , be it public or private .
nevertheless , there are some aspects that we proposed but were not accepted .
hence our abstention from the vote .
. what was really at stake in the vote on the fava and sanders-ten holte reports on the single european sky was the adoption of rules on the framework and organisation of european airspace , aimed at enhancing the operational capability , safety and punctuality of the air navigation services provided daily to millions of consumers .
most importantly , emphasis was also placed on safety considerations , with increased technical cooperation and interoperability , coordination with the military aviation authorities and the sovereign rights of member states in the sphere of air navigation .
i voted in favour and naturally welcome the meeting of minds that made it possible to …
. – the draft joint regulation currently before us has , out of the entire legislative package on the single european sky , given rise to more doubts at first reading than any other .
this regulation contains a separation of functions between national supervisory authorities and service providers , which will enable the various authorities to opt for the service provider of their choice , under a non-discriminatory system of charging .
although it is acknowledged that the services in question are clearly of public interest , this option is extended to operators in the private sector too .
in its proposals , the commission considered and addressed airspace management as if it were like any other economic service , comparable to the liberalised telecommunications or transport services markets , under the supervision of a european regulator .
the text that has been agreed on steers clear of this approach , because it not only expressly states that each member state can , within its own airspace , designate a service provider of its choice – under the auspices of national supervisory authorities and without deferring to other bodies – as a means of protecting total freedom for the ways and means of achieving this .
i therefore voted in favour .
i would also highlight the introduction of the concept of ‘ experience in the field ’ as a criterion for selecting organisations recognised by the national authorities , with mutual recognition of licences and the development of training programmes for controllers .
– although the need for airspace to be delineated , regulated and strategically managed at european level is not in question , we must , at the very least , be cautious in this context about adopting functional airspace blocks ( to replace the current flight information regions , where this is justified ) that do not correspond to national borders .
it should be recalled that the commission ’s original proposals completely ignored the unique and vital nature of the services in question and their relationship with the exercise of member states ’ public powers .
nevertheless , the text now before us remedies these shortcomings by giving the member states exclusive competence for delineating the functional blocks in question – since these cannot be changed by the eu – and acknowledges the need to ensure that minimum public interest requirements are met .
these will enable the best use to be made of airspace , taking account of air traffic flows and giving the various authorities the option to select a service provider of their own choosing .
i therefore voted in favour .
i share the rapporteur ’s position on the need , in pursuing a common transport policy , for measures to be adopted on systems , components and procedures that will facilitate real interoperability of the european air traffic management network .
in fact , unless there is some harmonisation and standardisation of operational rules , on procedures and equipment – thereby ensuring complementarity and consistency for rules and standards – it will be hard to establish a network that actually benefits all member states .
the low level of integration of national air traffic management systems and the slow rate of introducing the operational and technological standards necessary to obtain the sought-after additional capacity are the result of the fragmentation of the systems market and of the consequent lack of industrial cooperation .
this has led to unnecessary delays in developing and implementing new technologies and to a slow pace for introducing the means and concepts necessary for a much-needed increase in operational capacity .
i would emphasise that this interpretation does not mean sticking to uniform approaches ; instead , it expresses the view that measures must be confined to what is strictly necessary to ensuring the desired interoperability .
i must also issue a warning about the risk of business concentration that adopting these measures could entail and i believe that , rightly ...
. the aim of the proposal for a directive of 00 july 0000 on public contracts is to open up public markets and to establish a european internal market in the sector , in line with the objectives of the ‘ lisbon strategy ’ .
the award of public contracts generates a significant market that is highly tempting for the private sector .
it also constitutes an important instrument of economic policy with a potential socio-economic impact .
once again , in the name of transparency , non-discrimination and equal opportunities , and with public companies at a disadvantage , the decisive factor in awarding contracts is price .
this leaves the markets wide open for foreign companies to come in , which may lead to job losses , undermine regional development and adversely affect national economies .
in portugal , for example , there is a danger that more companies may go the way of the former <unk> and the viana do castelo naval yards .
this instrument could , however , have introduced other criteria for awarding contracts and in so doing could have provided targeted support for certain countries or regions to pursue economic , social and environmental objectives chosen by individual countries .
in this regard , while we welcome recent decisions made by the court of justice , conferring on the contracting authority the right to select its criteria , the framework remains very limited .
we therefore voted against the common position of parliament and the council .
. the aim of both proposals for directives , one general and the other sectoral , is to replace the four existing texts in order to simplify and modernise eu provisions relating to the award of public contracts .
this is something i naturally welcome .
the new provisions must ensure that the internal market works better and must ensure greater transparency in the awarding of contracts .
i therefore welcome the outcome finally achieved in conciliation , particularly on the final point on which there was still a difference of opinion : defining criteria for awarding contracts .
the system has improved substantially and has become easier to understand , thereby facilitating the free movement of goods relating to public supply contracts , freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services relating to the award of public service contracts and of public works contracts in member states by the state , regional and local authorities and other public bodies .
i also endorse the proposal to encourage the use of electronic signatures as a way of guaranteeing and reinforcing the confidentiality of proposals .
lastly , i welcome the call , also agreed in conciliation , for member states to guarantee that these directives can be implemented using mechanisms that are effective , accessible and transparent .
. the aim of the reform of legislation currently before us on public contracts in the water , energy , transport and postal services sectors is to open up markets and to establish a genuine internal european market in these sectors .
the commission ’s proposal for a directive of 00 july 0000 complements the ongoing process of liberalisation in the energy , postal services and transport sectors , in line with the aims and targets set out in the ‘ lisbon strategy ’ .
it also advocates opening up water management to the private sector .
in this regard , public contracts stand in stark contrast to public service supply and , in the case of water , their purpose is to guarantee a legal framework for awarding contracts to private firms , which is current practice in various local authorities in portugal .
it is odd , to say the least , that in the report on services of general interest in the last plenary session , parliament displayed its opposition to opening up the water supply market , while here it tacitly accepts such a move .
we therefore voted against the common position of the council and parliament , although we do acknowledge some improvements on the original proposal .
– two pieces of community legislation are being amended today : one on the procedures for the award of public works contracts , public supply contracts and public service contracts and the other on the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water , energy , transport and postal services sectors .
we find these changes , which are based on the principles of free competition in an open market , worrying , coming as they do at a time when france is moving towards greater decentralisation and is engaging in a national review of public procurement .
we want to ensure that the public services concerned continue to cover the same geographical area and provide the same services .
we are therefore voting against these two directives .
mr president , my group voted against this agreement .
we agree that some good things were agreed in the review of the packaging directive .
however , there is a major problem in that the agreement itself violates the spirit of the landmark ruling by the european court of justice , in procedural terms both in terms of the substance and the letter of the european treaties .
in february , the european court of justice ruled that waste incineration in municipal waste incinerators could not be counted as a form of recovery , even if energy was generated as a result .
the council , however , instead of increasing recycling or environmentally sound recovery to meet the recovery target , insisted on putting incineration on an equal footing with recovery , contrary to the ecj ruling .
although this issue was not a subject for conciliation as no parliamentary amendment to the council ’s common position had been adopted , by bringing it into the conciliation process the council violated article 000 ( 0 ) of the ec treaty .
my group very much disagrees with the procedure and the result of the conciliation .
we also find it very alarming that incineration , which we consider detrimental to the environment , has actually now been included as something to aim for .
. i endorse this report , which addresses a question that is crucial in terms of its impact on the lives of eu citizens .
the purpose of approving a new legal instrument , a directive , is to reduce the amount of packaging and other polluting waste products , by setting out a series of bolder objectives than those provided in the previous directive , which is still in force today .
the most significant moves are to raise the compulsory minimum level of recycling of packaging waste from 00 % to 00 % by 0000 and to provide a series of specific actions aimed at recovering and recycling the various materials commonly used in the manufacture of packaging .
i endorse the idea that return , collection and recovery systems in member states must be open to all interested parties and must avoid discrimination against imported products and against heavier materials .
while i understand that , in the absence of adequate infrastructure , the targets that have been set are utterly unrealistic , i am bitterly disappointed that as far as my country is concerned , along with greece and ireland , the implementation of this new directive has been postponed until the end of 0000 .
i voted in favour .
– mr president , it is part of the european parliament ’s legislative activities in the community to undertake the difficult and sensitive role of controller of the executive authority in all of its forms .
when carrying out its tasks , it has to assess the gravity of the lapses that inevitably occur at any time and in any place as a result of human nature ; it has to be conscientious in exercising control but must do so without stifling initiatives and , above all , it should act in the general interest and avoid taking sides .
unfortunately , the european parliament has not managed to comply with these rules , neither in the eurostat affair nor in respect of the committee of the regions .
that is why i voted against .
mr president , i would like to explain why our group , the group of the european peoples ’ party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , has abstained on amendment no 0 in mr casaca ’s report .
the word ‘ abstention ’ is reminiscent of certain expressions commonly used in surveys such as ‘ do not know , no comment ’ and , in this case , we believe that we members of this parliament do not yet know either the magnitude of the facts , in relation to eurostat , or the possible responsibilities stemming from them .
and ‘ no comment ’ , in the sense that olaf , a body responsible for combating fraud , has not provided this parliament or any of its committees with adequate information in this regard , which could provide a detailed and complete picture of the situation .
under these circumstances , a vote in favour of the amendment would imply that we had full knowledge of the facts and that as a result we were passing judgment in terms of certain responsibilities .
a vote against would also mean having knowledge of the facts and drawing a line under the issue as if it had already finished , without clarifying responsibilities .
it was therefore better to await any news which may arrive from olaf .
i cannot end without saying that we believe parliament has shown incoherence this morning , and the majority has rejected the individual responsibility of commissioners , immediately after an individualised reference , which , in our opinion , is unfair , since it is untimely , partial and hasty .
we trust that olaf will soon provide the information we need in order to issue a reasoned judgment .
we believe that what is termed the eurostat affair has revealed that reforms are required within the commission regarding the control and monitoring of the eu authorities ’ activities .
we believe , however , that to demand commissioner solbes ’ resignation would be too far-reaching and not very constructive .
the commission has acknowledged that mistakes have been made and , in our opinion , it is now up to the commission , together with other institutions , to find models for a more effective and more transparent system of internal control .
if the commission does not present a better system , a debate can begin about not granting discharge for 0000 .
. – i entirely endorse the casaca report , which states that , at the time that parliament gave discharge in respect of the budget for the 0000 financial year , it had not been made aware of certain important items of information , particularly on the eurostat affair .
like mr casaca , i denounce the commission ’s withholding of information , its ‘ culture of secrecy , complexity and lack of clarity ’ , and the commissioners ’ failure to face up to their political responsibilities ( paragraph 00 ) .
it is necessary , though , to take this argument to its logical conclusion by also stating what has brought about this culture of <unk> bordering on arrogance : it is a consequence of the privileged position accorded to the commission among the institutions , and of the sense of superiority which follows from it , and it is this sense of superiority that it is desired to bolster by means of the european constitution .
the casaca report also highlights two other intolerable states of affairs .
the first of these is the commissioners ’ lack of any clear and effective authority over their directors-general ( paragraph 00 ) , which means that the commission ’s departments have become fiefdoms in the true sense of the word .
there is also the commission ’s consistent refusal to investigate the real ownership of companies applying for contracts and grants from the commission , especially when there are strong suspicions that commission officials are their true owners ( paragraph 00 ) .
. this report concentrates mainly on the eurostat case and the irregularities that have been detected since 0000 .
let us not forget that eurostat has been reaping the consequences of the commission ’s policy of outsourcing services , which has led to irregularities , fraud , nepotism and cronyism .
it is also true that services carried out by private firms have been of a lower quality than the commission ’s internal services .
we welcome the proposals to keep eurostat services in-house and to review current contracts .
as for relations between eurostat and national statistics services , we must not overlook issues of data protection regarding information passed between administrations .
the recent case undermines the credibility of the commission ’s administrative reform and shows the way in which internal information structures become corrupted , in which the prevailing culture of secrecy has given rise to ‘ financial envelope systems ’ in eurostat and in which the information and communication systems within the commission have managed to remain oblique .
consequently , we regret the fact that the president of the commission did not propose structural changes to relations between commissioners and directorates-general , that he did not reach any conclusions regarding the commissioners ’ political responsibilities and that he did not condemn mr solbes mira , the commissioner responsible for eurostat , for not acting sooner , in the face of mounting evidence of irregular financial management .
i chose to vote in favour of amendments nos 00 to 00 and , in that way , went against the line taken by the group of the european people ’s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats .
the reason for this is that these amendments are keenly critical of the serious irregularities at eurostat .
i also voted in favour of amendment no 00 which regrets the fact that commissioner solbes mira , the commissioner directly responsible for eurostat ’s administration , did not act sooner in response to the unsatisfactory state of affairs and that he did not accept political responsibility .
i also supported amendment no 0 , expressing the view that the accountability of the commission would be strengthened in the future if the commissioners accepted that they had individual political responsibility for their departments .
the report as such was constructive , however , and i therefore voted for it in the final vote .
the report was adopted by 000 votes in favour , with 00 votes against and 0 abstentions .
. satellite navigation is a particularly important space application with many uses : in shipping , in aircraft navigation , even in search and rescue operations .
the development of the galileo satellite navigation system by the eu would be a contribution to mankind if , despite assurances that it is a purely non-military system , there was not every indication that the european imperialists also intend it to be used for military purposes , within the framework of their ambition to share the role of global policeman with the usa .
among other things in yesterday 's debate , commissioner de palacio mentioned that the system will have , over and above the signals to which everyone will have access , some signal to which only the states will have access .
although the report by mr <unk> has several positive points in comparison with previous reports on this matter , it leaves a number of questions on military use unanswered .
that is why the meps of the communist party of greece abstained from the vote .
i voted against the resolution on european space policy as all amendments concerning the need to guarantee the peaceful use of <unk> were not carried . this illustrates the real intentions lying behind the desire for an eu space policy - it is driven by the desire to establish the eu as a military superpower .
the inclusion of china in eu space policy , and galileo in particular , is not acceptable until china becomes a fully democratic state and recognises basic human rights .
galileo was sold to the european parliament as a civil project , and that is what it should remain .
this is one of the main arguments in favour of a european satellite system given that the american gps system is a military project which the us government can jam at any moment .
with the inclusion of the fifth application - the public regulated service or <unk> - it is impossible to guarantee that this encrypted signal , which is reserved for the state , will not be used for military purposes .
given its future military application and china 's inclusion in the project i voted against the report .
. as stated in the commission ’s original proposal , this technology has clear strategic importance and may also generate significant economic benefits .
the current systems in the us ( gps ) and russia ( glonass ) are both financed and run by the military , which means that signals may be interrupted or tampered with at any moment in order to protect the national interest .
galileo straightaway has the distinction of being a strictly civilian project , and so it must remain .
it is , moreover , increasingly seen as an important means of protecting nature and of managing and conserving natural resources .
we are already seeing its uses in agriculture and in civil defence ( helping to select crops or predicting natural disasters ) .
other areas such as air , sea and river transport will benefit enormously from the emergence of this european technology .
i welcome the fact that the project is on schedule , and the fact that egnos , the european geostationary navigation overlay service – a system intended to strengthen the gps signal , especially in civil aviation – is expected to be fully operational by april 0000 .
i should lastly like to underline the need to ensure that it remains free or almost free for users of basic services ...
– mr president , the european parliament ’s adoption today of the new resolution on the draft european constitution is a tacit recognition that it was wrong to ask the italian presidency to achieve the impossible , which is what it did in the proposal that we adopted in december .
the european parliament would grow in stature if it were to acknowledge this explicitly , but no one is perfect .
it also goes without saying that the european parliament should at least examine the written results of the naples conclave before expressing an opinion on their value , which it has just done , because these written results were submitted to the heads of state or government by the italian presidency .
i deplore the fact that in almost two months , parliament still has not considered doing so .
having said this , the draft constitution remains a bad and dangerous initiative and i still do not see any reason therefore to hope that it will be adopted at either easter or trinity .
that is why i voted against .
mr president , i also voted against this resolution .
it is not in the interests of european citizens or in the interests of the european union as whole .
it is regrettable that there is such a mad rush to finalise this by may .
it is completely unacceptable .
the convention was not set up specifically to draft a constitution for europe .
something like this needs a lot more time .
there needs to be a lot more consultation with the public in general : that is why i voted against it .
it is also regrettable if the irish presidency is being forced and pressurised into finding some agreement on this during its term of office .
it is wrong to imply that somehow the irish presidency may be a failure if this issue does not go through .
there is plenty of time : we have years to go in relation to this .
let the ten new countries in and let them find their feet first before we start rushing into further european integration .
. – in its resolution on the irish presidency ’s programme , parliament is attempting to rush the igc ’s negotiations by demanding that it finalise a text for the constitution before 0 may 0000 , which is the date of enlargement .
i did not vote in favour of this demand , as the member states must be allowed time to see precisely where this bad document would take them .
the council ’s statements , however , have shown us that it has had a sudden attack of the scruples over the plan for a single statute for meps .
i can do no other than take satisfaction in this , having for years been a constant opponent of this plan for reasons that can all be found in my previous interventions , notably those on 00 december of last year .
the council , which had for years turned a deaf ear to these arguments , has suddenly started to listen to them as the elections draw near .
whereas , until now , it appeared to entertain the idea of making meps financially independent of their countries , the prospect of the voters ’ dissatisfaction with this improper inducement has brought it to its senses .
i conclude that this is much the same thing as is happening with the draft european constitution .
elections are the beginning of wisdom .
. pressure aimed at forcing through the so-called ‘ european constitution ’ is coming from all sides ; from government representatives – special mention here goes to france and germany – from the commission , parliament , and from the union of industrial and employers ' confederations in europe ( unice ) , which has reaffirmed its eagerness for ‘ urgent agreement on the eu draft constitution ’ .
in light of the first ministerial-level meeting of the irish presidency , which centred on what should be done in the near future – and in which , according to the minutes ... , the proposal of the ‘ european constitution ’ as a basis for negotiation drafted by the ‘ convention ’ and the desire to reach agreement before parliamentary elections in june will have been reaffirmed – parliament once again welcomes such an approach and urges reaching agreement by 0 may .
the forces and interests behind the so-called ‘ european constitution ’ – namely , major capital and the most powerful countries in the eu – have once again begun to mobilise .
all of which vindicates those of us who have been the first to denounce the real motives and the real dangers of the ‘ european constitution ’ and the first to call for it to be rejected out of hand .
. the motion for a resolution tabled by the committee on economic and monetary affairs clearly endorses the aims of competition policy , namely to establish free , competitive and open markets , and to promote the completion of the internal market .
stressing the primacy of competition over other considerations , be they economic , social or environmental , results in policies aimed at liberalising and deregulating the markets , in addition to a fundamental bias against state intervention in the economy , especially through state aid .
this is why we voted against the resolution .
– this resolution is a veritable eulogy of the globalist policy of free trade that is decimating our industry and our jobs and as such is an insult to the men and women who , each day , pay the highest possible price for the consequences of this ultra-liberal european economic policy , from which only a handful of faceless and stateless shareholders benefit .
entrusted to european civil servants who kowtow to the powerful lobbies emerging in brussels , european competition policy is the main vector for ultra-liberal globalisation in our countries .
bureaucratic control of cartels , abuses of dominant position and concentrations ; strict supervision of public aids disbursed to companies in difficulty ; submission of public services to market rule ; dismantling of customs protection which , in the past , safeguarded our economic interests : the record of the european commission and its accomplices is absolutely disastrous .
as someone who comes from a region of france that has fallen victim to this absurd policy , i know what all of this neglect has cost the french in terms of relocation , a decline in industrial activity ( textiles , steel and agri-food ) , the destruction of smes and , of course , in terms of unemployment , insecurity and poverty .
that is why , contrary to the representatives of the bankruptcy association sitting on the right and left of this house , i categorically reject this text .
mr president , the link between the common foreign and security policy and space policy is very clear , both in the commission 's white paper and in the resolution .
a lot of people think this is quite acceptable , but i do not think it is acceptable that the european union should want to be a military super power .
to be a credible military super power , of course , it needs a space policy .
the galileo technology is a very precise type of technology which will be used for military means .
there are a lot more important areas into which eu resources could be going , rather than this : it is clearly in the interests of the military .
it is completely unacceptable that the space policy and eu resources should be funding and facilitating military expansion or the development of new military weapons .
but is it right that european taxpayers ’ money should be going into something like this when people all over europe are crying out for essential social needs ?
such huge resources are being poured into this and it is not acceptable .
that is why i do not support it .
. the meps of the communist party of greece voted against the resolution on space policy in accordance with everything i said in my position yesterday and , furthermore , because the amendments which we proposed against the use of space for military purposes and to serve defence and security policy were not accepted .
we condemn the position of the group of the european people ’s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats ( including new democracy ) which voted almost in its entirety against the amendments , as well as the stand taken by the socialist group ( including pasok ) which , while voting in favour of the amendment which accepted the principle of the use of space solely for peaceful purposes , at the same time voted against an identical amendment opposing the use of space for military activities !
we believe that this <unk> behaviour is not the result of a split personality .
it is simply an artifice , an attempt to muddy the waters , an alibi to cover their all-round support for the militarisation of the european union and the militarisation of space .
we have today voted in favour of the present resolution on eu space policy , just as we previously supported the own-initiative report on the commission ’s green paper on european space policy on 0 october 0000 and the report on europe and space on 00 january 0000 .
we would however emphasise that the eu ’s commitment to the area of space policy should be based upon the agreement between the ec and the european space agency ( esa ) from 0000 and be limited to the competence the eu now has in the area of space research .
we reject an increased eu competence planned to be included in the treaty for establishing a european constitution .
european industrial cooperation in the area of space should mainly be conducted on an intergovernmental basis in accordance with the convention for the establishment of a european space agency .
. i feel that it is very important that cooperation should be extended between eu member states and other european states that have a formidable tradition in research in this field , such as russia , and countries further afield , in order to harness the potential for space exploration for peaceful purposes .
this will make a significant contribution towards addressing the serious problems and meeting the urgent needs faced by the human race .
i therefore deplore the fact that most members of this house voted against the proposals for amendments tabled by my group , which sought to ensure that ‘ space must be used solely for peaceful purposes , for the benefit of the entire human race ’ and which vehemently oppose ‘ any use of space for developing or supporting military activities ’ .
i therefore voted against .
– as usual , the european parliament has debated the future of an industrial sector without considering the workers who keep it going , if only in a secondary role .
for us , it is not a question of knowing whether that sector is competitive or not compared with products from elsewhere , and even less of advising the owners of the companies concerned how to become more competitive .
whether the textiles industry is competitive or not , it is deplorable that 000 000 jobs should have been axed !
we are opposing this text , not because the textiles industry needs to be protected , but because its workers do , in the same way that we need to protect workers in other sectors , such as aeronautics or information technology , which are laying off just as many staff because they need to modernise .
we are against the stupid market economy and against competition , for which the company owners and shareholders make the workers pay the full cost .
in this competitive environment , it is not only the workers in poor countries , exploited and forced to earn low salaries , who lose out , but also the workers in the so-called rich countries , who are thrown out onto the streets by their employers .
all the more reason why we are against workers in different countries being forced to compete against each other .
. i am delighted that the ep resolution before us includes two of my proposals , which i consider to be important means of supporting the textiles and clothing sector in the eu and in portugal .
the first of these is to create a specific community programme for the sector – with appropriate support mechanisms – especially for less favoured regions that depend on the sector , aimed at boosting research , innovation , vocational training and smes .
the second is to set up a community programme to stimulate brand creation and to encourage product promotion further afield , such as at international trade fairs .
i regret the fact , however , that other proposals were not accepted , such as the need for a genuine action plan that is specific , cohesive and clear , with regard to instruments , financial means and a timetable ; the need for a production chain mentality ; and the need for a sectoral approach in negotiations with the wto , so that the sector does not simply become a bargaining chip .
i also deplore the fact that the liberalisation approach has not been called into question and i am gravely concerned about the risks of relocation in the sector .
a thorough evaluation must be carried out into the impact of unbridled liberalisation in the sector , especially now that the textiles and clothing agreement has come to an end and that china has joined the wto .
i take note of the commission communication on the future of the textiles and clothing sector in the european union .
i cannot but support the parliamentary resolution on this issue .
faced with the challenges and dangers represented by the end of quotas on imports , the recent entry of china into the wto , ‘ imminent ’ completion of the doha round and the enlargement of the european union , it is our duty to act to protect this sector .
we can only encourage the measures that seek to favour new information and communication technologies and training .
adaptability is essential in this sector where methods change so much .
it is an essential competitive advantage faced with imports from asia .
research is , of course , equally essential .
all this is not , however , enough to preserve a viable textile sector in europe because china is also committed to research and to products with a high added value and never has any difficulty in quickly copying our innovations .
this is why i particularly support the amendments calling for real support for the european textile and clothing sector and of the regions that are home to it through a specific community programme .
. i welcome and endorse the motion for a resolution on the future of the european textiles and clothing sector .
after the impending enlargement and liberalisation , i sincerely hope that the recommendations contained in this proposal do not turn out to be mere declarations of good intent and are in fact translated into visible , concrete action .
this is the only way in which jobs can be guaranteed in the sector and in which we can safeguard what remains of europe ’s textiles and clothing industry .
the unilateral abolition of import quotas , set for 0 january 0000 , places the textiles industries of eu member states on an unequal footing compared with other producers around the world .
international trade will only be free , fair and equal if some measure of reciprocity can be guaranteed .
the eu and its member states must establish support programmes and incentives for smes , so as to stimulate investment in research and development .
i also welcome the greater emphasis that will be placed on problems related to protecting intellectual and industrial property , and most importantly on the fight against counterfeiting .
i feel that greater attention should be paid to the case of china .
specific measures must be taken to combat china ’s hegemony in the textiles and clothing sector .
only high quality production will give the european industry competitive clout in the current context , given ...
that concludes the vote . ( 0 )
i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned .
mr secretary-general , president-in-office of the council , high representative , commissioners , colleagues and distinguished guests , it is a great pleasure for me , on behalf of the european parliament , to welcome here today the secretary-general of the united nations , mr kofi annan .
i would also like to welcome the previous sakharov prize laureates who join us today : the president of east timor , mr xanana gusmão ; the president of kosovo , mr ibrahim rugova ; from china , mr wei jingsheng ; from algeria , ms <unk> ghezali ; from spain , representatives of ¡ basta ya ! ; and from angola , dom <unk> kamwenho .
allow me also to recall some laureates who are absent : her continuing fight for freedom and democracy in her own country prevents aung san suu kyi from joining us ; from turkey , leyla zana sends greetings of support and solidarity ; in cuba and not free to attend , oswaldo payá sends his greetings .
this is an important occasion for the european parliament , both symbolic and solemn .
symbolic , because today affords us , the european parliament and the united nations , an opportunity to mark and to celebrate the values and the public purpose that we share and hold in common .
ours is a union based on values of pluralist democracy , respect for the rule of law , the promotion of individual and minority rights , solidarity , sustainability , open economy and respect for cultural diversity .
arguably , our european union is the most successful conflict resolution process the world has seen and we are proud of that .
this house strongly believes in the value and worth of the united nations and its charter , and in multilateralism .
we are resolved to make our positive contribution to ensure that , in meeting the challenges and duties of the 00st century , multilateralism can and shall be effective .
we support the fight against global terrorism , but we also insist on recognising the duty to fight against global poverty .
as regards weapons of mass destruction , we stand firmly on the side of non-proliferation , but our instinctive european response is for engagement and not for isolation .
we have a responsibility to the security of our citizens in the union to ensure that our borders are not porous or open to international trafficking and crime , and yet we also have a duty before humanity not to be a ' fortress europe ' .
let me tell you , mr secretary-general , that as europeans , our union and its member states are proud to be the largest donor community of untied development assistance , humanitarian aid and food aid in the world .
we are proud of what we do , but we accept that we could and should do more .
we in the parliament are proud of our commitment in this union to the politics of sustainability – locally and globally – not least in our constant promotion of the kyoto protocol .
our belief in the rule of law has galvanised this house into being one of the earliest , most consistent and most vocal supporters of the international criminal court .
i can tell you , mr secretary-general , that we should prefer the due process of the international criminal court , any day , to the absence of due process in guantanamo bay .
our pledge to you today , mr secretary-general , is for europe , in all of its manifestations , to be a reliable regional partner for the united nations and what it stands for .
of course , today sees us gathered here , not just for its symbolic value , but also for a solemn purpose .
on 00 august 0000 , in baghdad , terrorism reached a new low , when 00 of your colleagues paid the ultimate price in the service of peace and international humanity .
joining us today – and i would ask those who can to stand and be recognised – are the relatives of some of those who paid that price , and some of the survivors .
i should like to welcome to our chamber mrs <unk> de mello , widow of sergio vieira de mello , and her son mr laurent de mello ; ms <unk> <unk> , sister of ms <unk> <unk> ; and mr luís <unk> and his wife .
as i remarked , we are also joined today by a number of those who survived that vicious assault : ms <unk> <unk> , mrs <unk> <unk> and professor gil <unk> , you are also very welcome here today .
you honour us with your presence today .
permit me to say to all of you that we know we cannot compensate your loss , but i hope you now understand that we have felt it .
finally , mr secretary-general – and this is why we are solemnly gathered here today – i should like to say to you on behalf of this parliament that for defending freedom and for promoting the values we have in common , it is my privilege to award to you , the united nations , the european parliament 's sakharov prize .
. mr president , thank you for that very kind introduction .
members of the european parliament , excellencies , ladies and gentlemen and dear friends , i am deeply touched that you have honoured my friend and colleague , sergio vieira de mello , and the many other un staff who lost their lives in working for peace in the world .
i am proud to accept the sakharov prize in memory of them .
this prize for freedom of thought is not only a worthy recognition of the ultimate sacrifice that they made in the cause of peace .
it is also a welcome acknowledgement of the kinds of people they were .
the brave men and women we lost in baghdad on 00 august – un staff and others – were free spirits and free thinkers and also soldiers of humanity and of peace .
earlier , president cox and i met some of the survivors of the attack and family members of those who were killed or injured .
they are with us in the chamber now . i thank them for joining us today and i accept this prize in their name too .
i also thank you , president cox , and all of you , as members of the european parliament , for inviting these special people to share this occasion .
it is a gesture that speaks volumes about the solidarity of the european union with the united nations .
like many who survived the blast , the united nations itself carries deep wounds .
but our determination is stronger than ever , and we value the solidarity of friends like you .
you showed your commitment this morning , when you adopted a resolution to strengthen the eu ’s political and financial support for the united nations .
in its long history , europe has seen more than its fair share of war , tyranny and terrible suffering .
but europeans have replaced that with a future of hope .
you have pursued the path of peace through multilateralism .
and today , the european union is a shining light of tolerance , human rights , and international cooperation .
after 0 may this year , that light will shine even brighter .
when you enlarge to 00 member states , you will cross a divide between east and west that once seemed unbridgeable .
enlargement is the greatest force for peace on the european continent .
the hope for further enlargement in years to come promises to build other bridges of cooperation and understanding – including between the west and islam , and between peoples who have fought each other in bloody wars .
as time goes by , the continent is also experiencing an enlargement of what it means to be european .
i look forward to the day when europe rejoices as much in diversity within states as it does in diversity between them .
many of your societies are already very diverse .
but all of your societies – and many others around the world too – will become more diverse in the decades to come .
this is the inevitable result of the movement of people across international borders .
that movement is not going to stop .
as an international community , we need to manage the movement of people across borders far better than we do ...
... not just for the sake of those who move , but for the sake of the countries they leave behind and those they travel through and those they migrate to .
people migrate today for the same reasons that tens of millions of europeans once left your shores – they flee war or oppression , or they leave in search of a better life in a new land .
those who are forced out of their homes – the refugees who flee in fear for their safety – are our collective legal and moral responsibility .
we have an agreed legal framework for their protection – the 0000 refugee convention .
however , when refugees cannot seek asylum because of offshore barriers , or are detained for excessive periods in unsatisfactory conditions , or are refused entry because of restrictive interpretations of the convention , the asylum system is broken and the promise of the convention is broken too .
your asylum system needs the resources to process claims fairly , quickly , and openly so that refugees are protected and solutions found for them .
european states need to move towards a system of joint processing and sharing of responsibilities .
along with others , the eu must also help strengthen the capacity of poor countries to provide protection and solutions for refugees .
after all , seven out of ten refugees seek refuge in developing countries , where resources are far more stretched and human rights standards more uneven .
if we ignore this fact , there is a missing link in our approach to refugees – as professor gil <unk> , who survived the baghdad blast and is with us here today , has rightly pointed out .
most immigrants are not refugees .
we call them voluntary migrants – and some of them truly are .
however , many leave their home countries not because they really want to , but because they see no future at home .
it is our shared duty to do what we can to ensure that there are more opportunities in developing countries .
if we truly forge a global partnership for development , in order to meet the millennium development goals , we will do a lot to reduce the incentive for people to leave .
your asylum systems are overburdened precisely because many people who feel they must leave see no other channel through which to migrate .
many others try more desperate and clandestine measures , and are sometimes injured or even killed – suffocating in trucks , drowning at sea , or <unk> in the <unk> of aircraft .
the lucky ones who get in often find themselves at the mercy of unscrupulous employers , and alienated from society .
some resort to people smugglers to assist their journey .
others fall victim to traffickers – especially women , who are forced into prostitution in a modern form of sex slavery , and become acutely vulnerable to hiv/aids .
this silent human rights crisis shames our world .
it also generates billions of dollars for shadowy networks of organised criminals , who subvert the rule of law in all societies where they operate .
it is the sovereign right of all states to decide which voluntary migrants they will accept , and on what terms .
but we cannot simply close our doors , or shut our eyes to this human tragedy .
the situation is all the more tragic given that many states which close their doors actually immigrants .
here in europe , your birth rates and death rates have dropped dramatically .
your populations are getting smaller and growing older .
without immigration , the population of the soon-to-be 00 member states of the eu – 000 million in 0000 – would drop to under 000 million people by 0000 .
some states – such as italy , austria , germany and greece – would see their populations drop by around a quarter .
that would mean that one in three italians , for example , would be over the age of 00 – nearly double the proportion today .
were this to happen , jobs would go unfilled and services <unk> .
your economies would shrink and your societies could stagnate .
many other countries – from japan , to the russian federation , to south korea – face the same problem .
there is no simple solution to this problem .
but immigration is inevitably an important part of the solution .
i would therefore encourage european states to open up greater avenues for legal migration ...
... for skilled and unskilled workers , for family reunification and economic improvement , for temporary and permanent migrants .
poor countries reap benefits from migration too – through remittances .
the amounts which migrant workers send back to their countries of origin are growing fast .
in 0000 , in formal remittances alone , migrants from developing countries sent back at least usd 00 billion to their countries of origin – that is 00 % more than the usd 00 billion those same countries received in overseas development assistance .
do not get me wrong , i do not pretend that migration is without problems .
immigrants bring to their host communities different cultures and customs , different languages and religions .
this is a source of enrichment , but it can be a source of discomfort – and even of division and alienation .
the challenge of integration is real .
almost every large new immigrant group has been reviled to some degree in the early days of its establishment .
the experience of some immigrants today is reminiscent of the hostility that the <unk> once faced in england , as did the germans , the italians and the irish in the united states , and the chinese in australia .
but the longer perspective is almost always far more positive .
integration is a two-way street .
immigrants must adjust to their new societies – and societies must adjust too . the word ' integrate ' literally means ' to make whole ' .
that is the imperative for europe today .
integration of the immigrants who have become permanent members of european society is essential for their productivity and human dignity .
it is also essential for the functioning of healthy , humane democracies .
they cannot extract the labour of immigrants and ignore other aspects of their humanity .
the great swiss writer max <unk> said of the european ' guest worker programmes ' of the 0000s : ' we wanted workers , but we got people ' .
acknowledging and responding to that reality is one of your central challenges – a reality that is reflected in the united nations migrant workers convention , which i urge european states , and indeed all states , to sign and ratify .
migration can also cause challenges for the countries migrants leave behind .
yes , they may gain remittances .
however , if they lose contact with their diasporas , they can lose some of their best and brightest talent .
this opens up new <unk> for international cooperation .
after all , just as developing countries often want to attract emigrants back home , developed countries often have an interest in immigrants returning home after a period of time .
international cooperation on this and other issues is key to managing migration better .
in the effort to build better international cooperation , you in the european union should be where you belong – in the lead .
you have already given more thought than most regions to this issue – and the tampere framework is a basis on which to forge a common european policy .
combating illegal immigration should be part of a much broader agenda – an agenda to harness the benefits of immigration , rather than vainly trying to stop it .
but sometimes , the breadth of the agenda has been lost amidst <unk> debates about clamping down on illegal immigration – as though that were the major purpose of migration policy .
the public has been fed images of a flood of unwelcome entrants , and of threats to their societies and identities .
in the process , immigrants have sometimes been stigmatised , vilified , even <unk> .
in the process , an essential truth has also been lost .
the vast majority of immigrants are industrious , courageous and determined .
they do not want a free ride .
they want a fair opportunity .
they are not criminals or terrorists .
they are law-abiding .
they do not want to live apart .
they want to integrate , while retaining their identity .
only through cooperation – bilateral , regional and global – can we build the partnerships between receiver and sender countries that are in the interests of both ; explore innovations to make migration a driver for development ; fight smugglers and traffickers effectively and agree on common standards for the treatment of immigrants and the management of migration .
that is why i am particularly glad that , last month , the global commission on international migration was established .
the commission is itself a welcome instance of north-south cooperation , co-chaired by distinguished public figures from sweden and south africa .
i thank all states who are supporting this vital work and i hope it will help promote greater public understanding .
above all , i hope it will win broad acceptance for a better normative and institutional framework for managing migration at the global level – a framework that has human rights at its centre .
but the most essential ingredient of all is leadership .
you , as members of the european parliament , have a vital role to play in providing that leadership .
the message is clear .
migrants need europe , but europe also needs migrants .
a closed europe would be a <unk> , poorer , weaker , older europe .
an open europe will be a fairer , richer , stronger , younger europe – provided you manage migration well .
we must not minimise the difficulties that migration can bring .
but let us also rejoice in the enormous contribution that migrants have made in science , academia , sports , the arts , and government – including some of you as members of this parliament .
and let us remember that , without migrants , many health systems would be <unk> ; many parents would not have the home help they need to pursue careers ; many jobs that provide services and generate revenue would go unfilled and many societies would age and shrink .
migrants are part of the solution , not part of the problem .
they should not be made the scapegoats for a vast array of social ills .
the european union ’s anthem , beethoven ’s ' ode to joy ' , speaks of the day when all humans will become brothers .
if sergio vieira de mello were with us today – and , indeed , if andrei sakharov were too – they would say to you what i say to you : the people who move across borders today , in search of a better life for themselves and their families , are our brothers and our sisters too .
let us treat them that way .
in that spirit , in all our common endeavours , let the european union and the united nations be beacons of hope for a better future for all mankind .
. mr president , it is a signal honour to take part in this sitting of the european parliament for the award of the 0000 sakharov prize to secretary-general annan and the entire united nations staff , and to commemorate in particular mr sergio vieira de mello and the many other un officials who lost their lives in the performance of their duties .
i can think of no more appropriate designation of a prize for freedom of thought than the name of andrei sakharov .
and i can think of no more fitting recipient of this prize than secretary-general kofi annan and his colleagues .
the enduring value of the sakharov prize is that it evokes continually the memory and example of an outstanding human rights advocate who lived and worked in circumstances where such advocacy was considered an act of dissidence .
this prize in his name sends out every year a clear signal of support from europe to those who are struggling for peace and human rights , often in the face of significant hostility and in conditions of personal risk .
i believe therefore that the parliament has made a wise and kind choice in reflecting on and commemorating the enormous sacrifices made by un personnel in the cause of peace and justice .
on 00 august 0000 we were all horrified at the appalling attack on the lives of un personnel in their headquarters in baghdad .
those who carried out this attack struck a violent and cowardly blow at the people best placed and most committed to bringing relief to the iraqi people .
the loss of sergio vieira de mello was a cause of particular sadness .
in my own country , as in many others , the outstanding work done by mr vieira de mello on behalf of the un , especially in timor leste , was widely known and enormously regarded .
i know that he would have made an enormous contribution as high commissioner for human rights .
un personnel throughout the world perform heroic and often <unk> work .
it is in many ways a pity that the prevailing image of the un derives so much from the moments of <unk> political drama in and around the chamber of the security council .
this image misses the depth of the commitment of many unknown un officials throughout the world , acting as peacekeepers , providing assistance to refugees , developing human rights capacity , coordinating emergency humanitarian assistance and protecting the rights of women and the marginalised .
the millennium summit declaration referred to the united nations as ‘ the common house of the entire human family ’ .
un staff , in their daily working lives , demonstrate the truth of this description .
we are indebted to secretary-general annan on many levels and for many things .
this morning , of course , i would draw attention to the courage and the clarity with which he has addressed the challenges facing the multilateral system and role that migration policy can play in it .
at the general assembly last september the secretary-general characterised the position to which the un had come as ‘ a fork in the road ’ .
and as recently as last weekend at the world economic forum the secretary-general noted that the conduct of international politics had become less favourable to the maintenance of a stable , equitable and rule-based international order and that the role of the un itself and the system of collective security were under serious strain .
it is because of the urgency of this threat that the council has <unk> itself to effective multilateralism .
a stronger , international society , a rules-based international order and strong international institutions are critically important eu objectives .
central to this is the eu support for a strengthened un .
intensified and effective cooperation between the eu and the un is a central priority for this presidency .
it is imperative that the un be given the means to meet successfully the many and varied challenges of today .
as the secretary-general said in his report last year on the implementation of the millennium declaration , human rights are universal principles , but inspiring as those principles are , they do not implement themselves .
the multilateral system embodied in the un charter is the only way that human rights and humanitarian law can be effectively defended .
it provides the only real means of addressing the varied threats of today : terrorism , weapons of mass destruction , poverty , hunger and disease ; together with new , or rather growing , challenges such as migration – to which the secretary-general has made particular reference today .
it is only through being multilateralist that effective action can be taken to meet the millennium development goals , for example , so that the glaring inequalities and unremitting human suffering which in turn create and foster so many threats to peace and security can be meaningfully addressed .
it is entirely in character that the secretary-general did not use this occasion to indulge the plaudits that inevitably and rightly come with prestigious prizes such as this .
instead he has chosen to direct our attention to the challenges of a major pressing issue , that of migration .
this is an issue with which my own country has endured historical experience accumulated through generations who migrated from ireland and made lives for themselves abroad .
it is now an issue of major global significance which needs to be put higher up the international agenda .
globalisation has given rise to an unprecedented movement of people , in turn giving rise to unparalleled challenges .
like the secretary-general i welcome the establishment last month of the global commission on international migration .
un high commissioner for refugees lubbers attended the informal meeting of eu justice and home affairs ministers in dublin on thursday last , at which there was a constructive discussion of proposed european asylum and migration legislation .
this was very useful and we look forward to building on this valuable dialogue with such an important partner , the united nations .
in october 0000 the european council in tampere agreed on the creation of an area of freedom , security and justice in the eu , firmly rooted in our shared commitment to human rights , democratic institutions and the rule of law .
this freedom is not the exclusive preserve of the union ’s own citizens .
it must also be available to those whose circumstances lead them justifiably to seek access to our territory .
in its proposals and actions on immigration and asylum , the union is committed to taking account of both the humanitarian and economic aspects and to ensuring full respect for the human rights-based principles enshrined in the european convention on human rights and other international norms .
we must confront this challenge with effective action based on our ambition in 0000 to complete this agenda by the middle of this year .
for the european union , the united nations is more than a political affiliation .
as the nobel committee stated in awarding the nobel peace prize to kofi annan and the united nations staff in 0000 , it granted the prize ‘ to proclaim that the only negotiable route to global peace and cooperation goes by way of the united nations ’ .
we are deeply grateful therefore to the secretary-general for his ceaseless work in defending the multilateral system .
we wish to record our deep appreciation of the un staff all over the world serving the cause of peace and justice , human rights and development .
and we remember those among the un staff who have given their lives in this cause .
therefore , mr. president , let me join you in commending the award of the sakharov prize to the united nations secretary-general and his staff .
. mr president , it is , on behalf of the commission , a particular pleasure to be able to say a few words today as the secretary-general receives the sakharov prize on behalf of the united nations .
it is a particular pleasure because it is extremely difficult to recall another occasion on which the aims of an award and its recipient have <unk> so perfectly .
checking the statute of the prize , i found that it can be awarded for particular achievement in any of four fields : defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms , safeguarding the rights of minorities , respect for international law , and the development of democracy and the implementation of the rule of law .
by my reckoning , that means we should today be awarding the prize four times over .
it is being given , of course , in memory of sergio vieira de mello , and his life exemplified those values .
its barbaric curtailment leaves the world a good deal poorer .
sergio vieira de mello was an extraordinary man .
i was privileged to see his work at first hand , in hong kong , in kosovo and in east timor .
he was gallant , he was wise , he was dashing , he was principled and he was immensely effective .
we are very fortunate that the un is blessed with other , equally talented individuals , and is led by one as well .
kofi annan has made an immense contribution to furthering the effectiveness of the un – and its constituent parts – where it matters : on the ground , across the globe .
under his authority , both in overseeing its peacekeeping operations , and subsequently as secretary-general , the un has brought protection , comfort and hope to millions .
the secretary-general has done this in the face of unprecedented challenges to the authority and even the fundamental rationale of the organisation .
he has consistently risen to and overcome those challenges , unflinching and with his dignity wholly intact .
right from the start , with the renewal of the united nations plan for reform , through the review of peacekeeping operations , the millennium report , the call to action on hiv/aids and the establishment of the current panel on threats , challenges and change , the secretary-general has ensured that our collective focus is in the right place at the right time .
he does so once again today with his words on our obligation to develop a viable humane approach to asylum and immigration .
i make this point as one , like many in this house , who is a descendant of migrants – in my case , of those who fled from the famine and hunger in ireland in the 00th century to which the minister referred .
the secretary-general has reinvigorated the staple work of the un institutions , the work that is done by those <unk> unsung heroes : promoting economic development , feeding the hungry and educating the world .
and he has ensured that this work responds flexibly to challenges never imagined by the founders of the un : political challenges , military challenges , even medical challenges .
i do not think that it is an exaggeration to say that the secretary-general ’s personality and wisdom exemplify all our warmest and highest aspirations for the institution that he leads , the institution which he has served with such distinction for so many years .
like all members here today , i salute the un and i salute the secretary-general with admiration and humility .
i also commend his speech and the sentiments which underpinned it to the elected members of this parliament and to those who elect them .
i hope that in the months ahead these are arguments that we hear put with compassion and commitment to those who will , i trust , be doing their democratic duty .
– mr president , mr secretary-general annan , mr president-in-office of the council , mr high representative , commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , this is a significant day in the history of the european parliament , and the group of the european people ’s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , extends a very warm welcome to you , mr annan .
when , in the conference of presidents and in this house , we voted that you should receive the sakharov prize for 0000 , we did so gladly and not merely as a matter of political judgment .
those who work for the united nations dedicate themselves to human rights and democracy , and so it is only right that the sakharov prize should be awarded to the united nations .
today , we remember andrei sakharov , whose great intellectual and moral strength can be felt to this day by those who visit his simple grave in the <unk> cemetery outside moscow , and our desire is that the russian people may follow his example ; that , in russia and around the world , people may bring to life the ideals of andrei sakharov , that great physicist , philosopher and campaigner for human rights .
today , our thoughts are also with his widow , yelena bonner , who shared decades of exile with him and to whom our group awarded the schuman medal , and today we greet her in her simple and modest home in moscow ’s <unk> <unk> .
we would have been glad of the presence of the sakharov prize laureates leyla zana und oswaldo josé paya sardiñas , who , along with others , are unable to be with us today .
andrei sakharov once said that the most important voice is the one that cannot be heard , and my hope for the people of cuba is that they may be enabled to speak clearly .
although , mr secretary-general , there is much that could be said about immigration , which involves integration , we share the same values of human dignity , democracy and the rule of law , so , all things considered , we are taking the same road , and i hope that you will , as secretary-general , see the day when the european union , with a seat of its own , can defend these values in the security council and in the united nations .
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , high representative , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to say , on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists , that it is a great honour to receive the secretary-general of the united nations , mr kofi annan , today .
my group had the honour of nominating the secretary-general for the sakharov prize , and i would like to thank the other political groups for having ensured an overwhelming majority in parliament in order to express a common will to acknowledge the difficult and heroic work of the united nations and to encourage it to persevere in the noble cause of world peace and stability .
my group does not just wish to pay tribute to sergio vieira de mello and the other victims of an heroic struggle , but also to acknowledge the efforts of many united nations officials and chiefs who are continuing their work , and i would like to mention two symbolic names , those of mr blix and mr el baradei , who have done important work in favour of peace and the reduction of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
over the last two years we have not just seen terrorist attacks which have led to the deaths of many innocent people , but also an unprecedented assault on the international institutions , in particular the un .
therefore , secretary-general , i would like to reaffirm the importance of solidarity and close cooperation between peoples and nations .
in this regard , you have given us a lesson today on the importance of migrations , and i would say , on behalf of my group , that we thank you for this brave and committed speech because we are living in a world in which globalisation applies to capital , to services and to products ; but ...
... is not applied to people .
taking from your speech the elements which need to be carried out in the european union , i would also like to offer you our cooperation in the work you have begun on the reform of the united nations , with a view to ensuring that the un , together with the international monetary fund , the world bank , the world trade organisation and the international labour organisation , can work together .
i believe this is a common cause which both the european union and the united nations must work on .
in summary , mr president , i would also like to say that we are clearly committed to multilateralism as opposed to unilateralism , to preventive action rather than pre-emptive attacks , and that it must not be said that the united nations is incapable : namibia , south africa , mozambique , el salvador , haiti , nicaragua , cambodia , guatemala , kosovo , timor , sierra leone , liberia and the congo demonstrate that the united nations is necessary and important and is a legitimate and noble cause and that we must support its efforts .
secretary-general , liberal democrats and reformers in this house echo your words on immigration .
we recognise the value that immigrants bring to europe and we understand that closing europe 's front door will only drive the desperate to seek access through the back .
many of us were migrants once upon a time and we know how ill it behoves our generation to shut the gates of mercy on mankind .
a europe of security and justice for all is a europe that extends those rights to those who justly seek a new life here .
like you , we recognise the political challenge that implies .
your words today remind us of the power of the united nations to transcend the parochial in us all .
the united nations has a precious power to speak for us all .
that is why my group wishes to see the return of the united nations to iraq as soon as the security situation allows .
credible and legitimate democratic government in iraq is not possible without the presence of the united nations .
we want a political settlement in iraq that guarantees the highest standards of civil and political rights for all iraqis .
the united nations was founded by the same generation who founded this european union – ‘ to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind ’ .
like this union it believes that the closer we sit at the table of peace and prosperity , the slower we will be to reach for the tools of war .
it is a sorry testament to a stubborn world that the un still seems such an unlikely experiment in international governance .
winston churchill once said that the un is designed not to take us to heaven , but to save us from hell .
in order to do that better the un must reform .
as its largest contributors , the eu and its member states have not only the weight to insist on reform but the responsibility to do so .
a mature europe would find the political will to put behind it an institutional settlement at the un that leaves power where it lay in 0000 .
a mature europe would insist on a permanent membership that reflected the realities of the 00st century .
it would accept that the current veto is a tool of obstruction , a privilege that can no longer be justified .
finally , secretary-general , on behalf of the liberal group allow me to pay tribute to the members of your organisation who will not see you take this prize in their name today .
your staff who lost their lives with sergio vieira de mello – including fiona watson who was known to me – died defending a vision of national renewal in iraq that is now our duty .
– mr president , secretary-general , thank you for your magnificent speech , which was very apt and brought each country face to face with its responsibilities .
we are honoured to have you with us in this house – your presence here is highly symbolic – and in our turn we too welcome , with respect and sympathy , the family and friends of mr vieira de mello and the other victims of the dreadful terrorist attack in baghdad .
one year ago , secretary-general , almost to the day , the european parliament adopted a resolution in support of the mission of the united nations inspectors in iraq .
many of us still wanted to believe that it was possible to avoid the war , which we sensed would cause great devastation .
in the period that followed , it became apparent that what was happening in the united nations reflected world public opinion as never before .
the public took to the streets in their millions to demonstrate , while in the security council the majority of the member states resisted and did battle .
on all sides the goal was the same : to try to prevent a bloody , destabilising and irresponsible conflict .
rarely has the un been able to be as faithful as it was in those days to the first words of the charter , ‘ we the peoples of the united nations ’ .
we did not succeed , but the lesson was learnt .
a particular idea of how the world should be organised was , admittedly , seriously flouted by a coalition of states , but since then it has , however , been spectacularly validated by the collective experience , to the point that the former <unk> warriors are now appealing to the un .
this idea is firstly that war is certainly no way to resolve the world ’s problems .
secondly , it is that no nation , even a <unk> , can ignore the global challenges facing the international community .
finally , it is that there is more to building a world of peace than taking action against terrorist networks .
it is in all our interests to be aware of this and we all have a responsibility to create a new order .
that , secretary-general , is how we understand the particular tribute that we are paying to you and , through you , to the countless others who embody the universal values symbolised by your organisation .
– secretary-general , ladies and gentlemen , i confess that when i was listening to you , secretary-general , another great speech was resounding in my ears , the speech by martin luther king , who once <unk> in new york : ‘ i have a dream ’ .
and listening to you , i had a dream too , a dream that your words on immigration were echoed by all of the members of this house and did not remain yours alone .
i had a dream that all of the heads of government who say that they admire you , admired what you have just said and your lucid words on immigration .
i had a dream that finally the peoples listening to you admired your speech and your lucid and humanist views on immigration .
because , ladies and gentlemen , there is no point in giving mr kofi annan a standing ovation if , in our day-to-day work , in our resolutions , in our laws and in our countries , we do exactly the opposite of what he is asking us .
it is this idea , this strength and your lucidity that inspire me to salute you as the laureate of the sakharov prize .
– secretary-general , presidents , our support for the choice made by the united nations , of you and your colleagues , foremost among them sergio vieira de mello , is testimony to the confidence that we have in you and the high regard in which we hold you .
we also wanted to thank you for the work that you do at the head of this organisation and for helping to restore and reinforce its prestige .
for all of this , we thank you .
of course , in choosing you we also chose your colleagues , all of those who paid with their lives to fulfil their chosen role in the service of the most just and noble of causes .
to the families of those who are no longer with us , we wish to convey our solidarity and pay our respects , and our thoughts and good wishes also go to all of those who were injured and continue to endure physical suffering .
you have just spoken about the problems of immigration , secretary-general . you were right to do so .
of course , this is the utopia that will help the world to move forward and we are all aware of this .
if you believe , however , that the problems associated with immigration will be resolved solely by ensuring that the developed countries open their borders , you are mistaken .
obviously this is necessary , but it is not the answer to the problem .
i should have liked , secretary-general – but probably this was implicit in your comments – to hear you condemn the economic consequences of globalisation and the imbalance that this creates between developed and developing countries .
i should also have liked , secretary-general , to hear you express the wish that developed countries would increase their aid , because the only way – or at least the main and most pressing way – to resolve the problem is firstly to give all of those who are suffering in developing countries the means to live a normal life .
and that is why i regret the fact that the developed countries are all so reticent and overcautious in this regard .
at one time , general de gaulle said that if all of us had devoted 0 % of gdp to this problem it would have been to a large extent resolved .
well , it is not too late to do so .
and as well as applauding you , as you so richly deserve , perhaps all of those who are here , and in particular those who hold office through their parties in the governments of western europe , might be inspired to act on these resolutions .
secretary-general , every year , 00 million hectares of tropical forest are lost .
we are destroying the planet ’s biodiversity at the same rate at which the dinosaurs were wiped out .
there are more than 000 million active mines , distributed among 00 countries .
in ten years , two million children have been killed in wars or by landmines .
every day , 0 000 young people are infected with hiv .
more than four million young people have died of aids .
thirteen million have lost their mothers or both parents , but 00 % of them live in africa , so it is not , of course , really our problem .
or is it ?
when i was young , i dreamed of working for the un and of being able to play my part in uniting the nations of the world in peace and cooperation .
i am therefore very happy that , in the conference of presidents , i was able to register my group ’s unanimous support for the un , because never before have there been so many innocent and poverty-stricken children who need a <unk> from ourselves in our cosy little corner of the rich part of the world .
we who sit in parliament may disagree about a lot , but we can all agree in paying tribute to you as secretary-general of our common , worldwide organisation , the un .
no one can suspect the un ’s blue berets of having any remit other than peace .
i therefore hope that the un can be given a common and permanent military force to deploy once all peaceful means have been exhausted .
you must not only be secretary of a security council whose members are in disagreement .
you must also be general of a reformed and dynamic un .
in war , you must be commander-in-chief of all the generals , for , without un permission , it should again be prohibited to go to war .
it perhaps sounds naive , but it is still my dream that there will one day be so many naive people in the world that we shall not permit the destruction of our planet and the killing of innocent children through landmines , famine or hiv .
we would do well to transfer a couple of hundred euros in aid from each eu cow to those whose need is greater , namely citizens who today have to place their children in something that is not a bed , following something that is not a meal and perhaps with an illness that makes life before death all too short .
thank you , mr kofi annan , for doing more than ourselves to engage with the most important matters in the world , and thank you for your moving speech .
– secretary-general , on behalf of the italian radical party members , i should like , first and foremost , to echo the tributes paid to the memory of sergio vieira de mello and all of those who perished with him .
secretary-general , we welcome your call for a europe that is more open to immigration by men and women who have fled their countries in a bid to escape poverty and very often dictatorship .
in welcoming them , we need to tackle the root causes that drive them to leave their countries .
with this in mind , we very much appreciated your spelling out an idea several months ago that is both simple and revolutionary . ‘ democracy and human rights , though distinct concepts , are closely interlinked .
democracy , as a human right in itself , is implied in article 00 of the universal declaration of human rights , but it only functions in its fullest sense when other human rights are respected . ’ we wholeheartedly agree with you , secretary-general : democracy is a universal value to which every human being has a right and this is the challenge that we need to take up in the middle east , in africa and elsewhere .
secretary-general , in this connection , before concluding , allow me to mention the issue of the appointment of the united nations high commissioner for human rights .
as you know , on the initiative of the italian presidency a european candidate has been put forward , a member of this parliament .
this candidate has the support of the president of the european commission and of key figures from all of the union ’s institutions as well as from other countries and regional groups .
the fact that we have put forward a candidate signals europe ’s commitment to promoting and strengthening human rights , the rule of law and democracy wherever they are violated .
secretary-general , i would venture to hope that you will select this candidate .
. – mr president , speaking on behalf of our committee , i too would like to express our congratulations to mr annan , and to all those who , in the united nations , work for democracy , peace and freedom , and our appreciation for all those who have made such great sacrifices for them .
i also regret the fact that domestic political circumstances prevent the laureates from cuba , burma and turkey from being with us today .
what we have to do , i believe , is to advance democracy and freedom throughout the world , for human rights on the one hand , and peace on the other , are dependent on them .
democracy and freedom are the pillars without which no improvement is sustainable .
i believe that , if we succeed in this way in raising standards in the world ’s less-favoured areas , we will also be creating the right conditions for peace , freedom and human rights , and it is for that reason that we need to cooperate in this area .
the same is the case with political objectives and problem-solving , whether this be in the middle east or in cyprus .
while i have to say that i listened to what you had to say about migration with a great deal of admiration , i would also like to point out at the same time that migration is an admission of failure , for we should deal with problems where people actually live ; that is where we have to start .
on behalf of parliament i should like to thank the council for being present here today and also the commission , the high representative and the laureates of the sakharov prize .
i should also like to thank the relatives of the victims of the attack and the survivors for their very special presence here today .
and most of all , secretary-general , i thank you for being here and for the appeal to conscience which you launched in our house today .
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on thursday , 00 january 0000 . ( 0 )
the final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to rules 000 and 000a of the rules of procedure by the conference of presidents at its meeting of thursday , 0 february 0000 has been distributed .
i have not received any requests for changes to the agenda for monday .
mr president , as rapporteur for the own-initiative report on directive 00/000/ec on the organisation of working time , i would request that the vote take place on wednesday rather than tomorrow , since negotiations are being held between various parliamentary groups and they asked me a moment ago if we could do this .
if possible , therefore , we would like to be able to continue working tomorrow and vote on the report on wednesday .
mr president , i support this proposal because it gives us a chance to find a solution to this very cumbersome dossier .
as regards the oral questions on nuclear disarmament , i have received a request from the verts/ale group to wind up the debate with a motion for a resolution which could be put to the vote at the next sitting in brussels .
– mr president , the aim of the resolution is to prepare the guidelines before the conference to revise the treaty of non-proliferation .
traditionally , we conclude such debates with a resolution ; it therefore seemed right to do so in this case too , even though the resolution will be put to the vote during the next sitting .
– mr president , i believe that this is one of the most important policy issues currently under consideration and discussion in the sphere of international politics .
we frequently adopt resolutions that i do not believe are quite as significant as this , so we are very much in favour of there being a resolution to wind up this debate .
does anyone wish to speak against the request ?
mr president , my group is against a resolution .
( 0 )
mr president , it has recently been brought to my attention that the maltese labour party has submitted up to 0 000 petitions to the constitutional court in malta , the effect of which is to <unk> maltese citizens temporarily abroad for work or study from voting in the coming european elections .
should this be the case , this seems to be against the letter and the spirit of both eu law and convention , in that many of these nationals are outside of their home territory for perfectly legitimate reasons .
if this is true , this seems to be behaviour that is not consistent with the democratic process which this house would accept as the norm for a country which is shortly to become a member state of the european union .
i ask you therefore to investigate whether an attempt is being made to <unk> the electoral process in malta and to report back to this house with your findings .
i shall indeed enquire into the matter and report back to you , mr bradbourn .
mr president , everybody in this house is concerned about the human rights situation in colombia , and the visit of the president of colombia , mr uribe , gives this house the opportunity to make plain our concerns about that situation .
i rise specifically , mr president , to ask you to raise with mr uribe , the president-in-office and the commission the question of support for a proposed conference on humanitarian rights later this year .
it has been proposed by the umbrella organisation – an alliance of 000 ngos and civil organisations in colombia – which is seeking to engage the civilian population in finding solutions to the 00 years of conflict .
mr president , i will send you the details of this proposal and ask you to consider them and to raise this matter with president uribe when you meet him .
i would welcome your note on the matter .
exceptionally , president uribe will appear before the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy during the working day tomorrow .
there will be a direct opportunity for members of that committee to bring issues to his attention .
mr president , i would like to protest at the leniency shown by president musharraf of pakistan to the television confession of dr abdul <unk> khan .
this house has criticised pakistan 's exports of nuclear technology in the past and received condemnation from its government for doing so .
it is extraordinary that the sale of such dangerous wmd know-how to regimes as brutal as north korea results in a presidential pardon and the right to keep the illegally acquired payments .
it smacks of a public scapegoating exercise in the face of embarrassing evidence of official covert support by the government .
secondly , i would like to send my condolences to the people of moscow for the recent atrocious suicide bomb attack on their metro , which resulted in at least 00 deaths and 000 casualties , with everything pointing to chechen terrorists organised by a saudi al-qa ' ida follower .
i ask those in this house who proclaim the glory of the chechen freedom fighters how they account for the murder of innocent <unk> ?
mr president , in a few days ’ time it will be the 00th anniversary of the adoption by the european parliament of the draft treaty establishing the european union , created and proposed by altiero spinelli .
the conference of presidents called on the political groups to look into the possibilities for celebrating both this anniversary and the 00th anniversary of the death of jean monnet , one of the greatest creators of european integration .
i would , however , like to draw your attention , mr president , to the dissimilar nature of these two anniversaries .
celebrating the anniversary of the spinelli draft means not so much paying homage to altiero spinelli himself , as appreciating the far-sightedness of the european parliament that , 00 years ago , drew up and proposed the first treaty of a constitutional nature , something which it makes sense to stress today in the light of our renewed commitment to ensure that europe is in fact finally given a constitution .
as you correctly observed , mr napolitano , your suggestion was discussed by the conference of presidents .
it was decided that , in the last parliamentary session in may , we should observe a number of those anniversaries .
however , with regard to the specific observation you made about the spinelli report and the leadership of the european parliament , i will be happy to mark that day by making a declaration on behalf of this house , in line with your preference and your suggestion to the conference of presidents .
mr president , referring back to what mr napolitano said , frankly it seems to me that your reply had very little substance to it ; what we need here is , instead , much more than that .
this is not about commemorating altiero spinelli , but rather about seizing the opportunity of this important and historic date , which calls for a special sitting and not for one among many celebrations .
it would also be the opportunity to take a much bigger and more important step : let the european parliament do as much as it did then , with spinelli : that is to say , in order to promote the european constitution , immediately adopt the text that resulted from the convention , so concluding an act which , even without legal value , would have a huge political value .
this is what i ask of you , mr president : that the european parliament have the courage , twenty years on , to implement the same initiatives .
i call on you and on the chairmen of the political groups , above all those who refer to the european idea , to do this .
i hope that they are true to their tradition .
– mr president , i just wanted to raise something briefly .
a report by me on industrial associations has been put on this week ’s agenda , without my knowledge , and , above all , also contrary to everything agreed by parliament with the authorities here .
i learned of this when someone from in london phoned me about it .
on being asked how this could come to pass , the parliament office responsible stated that it had been done with the groups ’ agreement .
when i asked them , i was told it was the parliamentary services that had done it .
this does not show this house in a very favourable light .
i now note – with gratitude , of course – that the report ’s arrival will be subject to the rapporteur ’s agreement , as certain groups are aware that it is the subject of important negotiations that are still in progress .
in practice , though , it would have been nice for this to have been done a bit more transparently and efficiently .
i will get back to you on the detail when i have had a chance to study the matter .
mr president , portuguese newspapers have recently reported appalling cases of mistreatment , abuse and even slavery , to which portuguese workers have been subjected in various eu countries , such as france , the netherlands and the united kingdom .
the portuguese newspaper this morning ran a story entitled ‘ more portuguese citizens ill-treated in the netherlands ’ , which stated that the dutch authorities had been informed of the situation .
according to the story , however , the reports from that country are marked by unprecedented abuse perpetrated against portuguese workers .
there are accounts of mistreatment of workers in some companies in the netherlands , or at the hands of <unk> ; workers are denied the most basic of rights , such as sufficient food to eat and accommodation fit for human habitation ; real organised networks are said to be operating in various countries to recruit workers , which is absolutely scandalous .
immediate action must be taken , mr president , to put an end to this state of affairs .
i request , mr president , that the commission and the council be notified and that immediate action be taken to eradicate the problem of these appalling attacks on workers ’ rights and on human rights in general .
i would like you to send to my office copies of the material you referred to .
i will indeed take up the matter , as you suggest .
mr martin , the report for which you are rapporteur was placed on the agenda following the normal procedures .
however , having learned of your difficulties as regards its scheduling and in deference to you as rapporteur , it has been withdrawn from the agenda .
– mr president , i apologise for bringing this issue up again ; i have so far heard that only in the original language .
i would just like to reiterate that there was a clear agreement with the parliamentary services that this report would not be put on the agenda until march or april .
i then learned from in london that it was given a slot in february .
only then did i say , ‘ please , not yet ! ’ this is where you must not confuse cause and effect !
the conference of presidents will decide when it returns to the agenda , but it is not on the agenda now .
that is the answer to your question .
mr president , last week the commission ruled against the level of assistance being given by the charleroi airport authorities to a certain airline .
not only do i sympathise with the public authorities responsible for charleroi , i admire them for trying to take action to stimulate much-needed economic growth and jobs , in the light of declining traditional industries .
the benefits of low-cost air travel have been felt over a much wider area than just around charleroi .
for example , the route from <unk> to charleroi is the only air link from the west of scotland , a very populous area , to the capital of europe area .
while i recognise that the commission sees fit to implement state aid regulations in certain ways , what about the consumers ?
i hope that the commission will not be over-enthusiastic and end up disadvantaging consumers , including many groups who wish – and need – to visit our headquarters and the other european institutions to learn more about how europe actually works .
mr president , 00 years ago , the islamic republic of iran was founded , leading to the violent infringement of human rights and , in particular , the violation of women ’s rights .
the question is , whether we are now seeing the start of a similar development in occupied iraq .
on 00 december , a number of rulings concerning divorces , marriages and children etc. were replaced by sharia law in the otherwise secular state of iraq .
now , i hear that the leader of the organisation of women 's freedom in iraqis under violent attack from islamic groups .
her name is <unk> mohammed .
i should very much like to ask you to protest , on behalf of parliament , against the attacks on women ’s rights that are now gathering speed in iraq , and also to protest to the occupying forces , that is to say the alliance of so-called volunteers , against this development .
mr president , i too would like to raise the issue of the visit by the colombian president , mr uribe , to this parliament .
my group was not in favour of this invitation , and , as i understand it , neither was the eldr group nor the gue/ngl group .
it is unfortunate that the pse group did not support us on this .
there is a great danger that president uribe will use this as a propaganda stunt to give the impression at international level that everything is fine .
you only have to look at the un reports on bogota , whenever they are published , to find accounts of gross human rights violations .
the recently introduced legislation , in particular the anti-terrorist statute which was adopted in december , gives judicial powers to the armed forces .
this is another area of grave concern .
this parliament has to be very careful that it does not allow president uribe to use this opportunity as a propaganda stunt , to give an impression that somehow the human rights situation in colombia is improving .
we know from the grassroots organisations on the ground that this is far from the truth .
that false message must not be allowed to be sent out from this parliament .
mr president , it is a disgrace for the european parliament to receive the president of colombia , álvaro uribe <unk> , tomorrow with honours .
it is a disgrace for the socialists who made the proposal and for everyone who accepted it .
mr uribe and his government , with the support of the usa , are responsible for the death of thousands of trade union farmers and other grass-roots fighters .
they refuse ethnic reconciliation , they show contempt for the numerous recommendations of the un commission on human rights and they seek to suppress grass-roots dissatisfaction with military means .
mr uribe 's presence here shows that the european union is moving towards getting involved in the ‘ columbia ’ plan , through which the usa intervenes cruelly in this country , in an aim to achieve general control over the area .
we condemn all external intervention and call for all governments to stand by the side of the grass-roots forces in columbia so that the bloodshed and the activities of the paramilitary forces stop , peace is protected and human rights are respected .
we express the undivided solidarity of the communist party of greece with the columbian people who , we are sure , will win in the end .
– mr president , what i have to say has to do with the safety of meps and the measures taken by parliament to that end .
on 00 january , i left the parliament building in brussels around 0 p.m. by the exit onto the <unk> , going towards the rue de <unk> .
barely 000 metres from the parliament building , having halted at a red light , i heard an enormous bang and the <unk> window of my car was smashed in .
my handbag , which had been on the floor , was snatched .
i can assure you that a lady ’s handbag contains everything imaginable – cards , passport , and so on . such a thing can of course happen anywhere , but i find it an extraordinarily serious matter that it should happen so close to the parliament building .
what i find incomprehensible is that this happens time and time again ; i could name more than one other dutch lady mep to whom it has happened .
i came back to the parliament building , where i had a very kind reception ; about that i have no complaints .
the security guards came when called but – you are probably not aware of this – i could not make a phone call outside belgium .
i could not , therefore , make a call to block my credit cards , and i think that you will understand why that was my first concern .
the police were then called and i was able to go with them to the police station , albeit only by following them in my damaged car .
i managed to get to the police station , where there was an officer who spoke flemish , but not the sort that has any similarity with dutch .
he was a kind man , and there was nothing wrong with him , but it all got very involved .
as i of course had nothing left on me – no money , no driving licence – i was told that i would be given an escort to , but that was not forthcoming .
it was at around midnight that i got to my hotel , where i was dealt with more efficiently .
i have sustained enormous loss , and i now want to ask you to ensure first of all that , in any such situation an international call can be made from the exits to the parliament building if an mep wishes to do so , and that assistance is available in getting to the police station , for i could have been a dane with absolutely no knowledge of dutch or a citizen of any other country .
it would of course also be very useful if money were available to make it possible to take a taxi .
moreover , i think it is of the utmost importance that there should be better security protection for meps .
as i have just said , the loss is enormous .
i will not say how much is involved , but i expect parliament to see to it that i am fully reimbursed .
i did not wish to interrupt you , mrs sanders-ten holte , because of the personal nature of the attack you mentioned and for which , i am sure , you have the complete sympathy of members of the house .
i shall ask parliament 's security services to draw up a report on this for us and for the bureau to see what general lessons we could learn as regards some of your suggestions .
we are also in ongoing discussions with the belgian authorities regarding security in brussels .
i would add that , so far , these have not resulted in a satisfactory or sufficient response as regards the requirements of this house .
mr president , i would like very briefly to go back over the resignation of mr david <unk> , the us official in charge of finding weapons of mass destruction in iraq , possessed , it would seem , by that country ’s government .
i would also like to go back over the statements made by the british specialist , mr kelly , which were followed by his suspicious death .
finally , i would like to go back over a recent admission by president bush , this sunday , in an interview broadcast by nbc , stating that saddam hussein and the iraqi regime did not , in all likelihood , possess weapons of mass destruction , but that the war was nonetheless justifiable because , if they did not have weapons of mass destruction , it could perhaps have been possible for them to obtain them one day .
i believe that we should be concerned about this because it clearly means two things .
first of all , mr bush and mr blair lied in a cynical and serious way .
then , a population has been starved for ten years under a false pretext , a war was launched under a false pretext and a state has been destroyed , also under a false pretext , with the backing of a number of governments of the european union , which is an extremely serious fact .
mr president , i should like to express my disgust and anger at the despicable anti-communist resolution adopted by the recent 00th conference of the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , which <unk> the barbaric , monstrous <unk> to communism and calls for a new witch-hunt to begin of the members and cadres of the communist parties who remain faithful to their high ideals .
the group of the european people 's party abuses and insults the memory of the millions of communists who gave their very lives to deliver mankind from the nazi monster .
at the same time , it shows that it supports , or even dictates the primitive anti-communism and blatant violations of human rights which prevail in the former socialist candidate countries .
it revives a spirit of vindictiveness which only presages hardships for our peoples .
we do not forget that the persecution of communists has always been followed by the persecution of every progressive perception .
the peoples do not forget that hitler also started persecutions with the communists .
with this disgraceful and extremely dangerous resolution , the group of the european people 's party really is seeking to stop the workers ' fight against reactionary , anti-grass roots policies .
they want to strike the pioneers of this fight , the communists who remain faithful to their ideals , because the followers are their friends and <unk> .
mr president , a few days ago , 00 chinese people lost their lives in <unk> bay in the north-west of england .
they were <unk> picking on the sands , the tide came in and they were all drowned .
would you agree with me that this tragedy , whilst clearly on british soil – or in british waters – is equally a european or international issue , and that we must work together to counter the international people-smuggling gangs that were exploiting these poor people who were being paid as little as one pound per day for their work ?
furthermore , this case once again highlights the clear need to establish an effective and efficient common european system for asylum and the same for immigration , including legal migration , as a matter of urgency .
it is clear that what is a united kingdom tragedy one day could easily occur in another country 's territory on another day .
mr president , i rise in response to the outrageous comments just made by mr gollnisch , who implied that david kelly , and i quote : ' died in suspect circumstances ' , and that tony blair lied .
the recent judicial inquiry has looked at all the facts surrounding these tragic circumstances and concluded quite clearly that there were no suspect circumstances surrounding the death of mr kelly , as he implied , and that mr blair did not lie to the house of commons on this matter .
whatever one 's view of the iraqi conflict – and there are different views in this house , in my country , and indeed in my party , and i have my own view on this – it is essential that we debate this matter based on the facts , not on fiction .
the fact is that i am now the one with the microphone that works !
mr president , i would like to draw attention to the complete disarray regarding free movement of citizens from the new member states .
it now seems – but it is by no means certain – that , with a mere 00 weeks to go until 0 may , 00 member states will take advantage of the facility to put obstacles in the way of free movement .
this has led to a spotlight on the two remaining states – ireland and the united kingdom – and to hysterical press reactions about being swamped by benefit tourists .
i hold no brief for the way the british press is reacting , nor for the rather uncertain reaction of the united kingdom government , but i believe that the original decision to allow full free movement was and is economically , politically and morally right .
commission forecasts show that maybe every year there would have been one mobile worker from the east for every 0000 inhabitants in the west , if it had been shared among all states .
there may have been some justification for special measures in border areas , but the way this panic has spread and infected most member states is shameful .
it treats the new member state citizens as second class , contrary to all the promises they were given , and it displays – as on so many other issues such as iraq , the constitution and the budget – a depressing lack of eu solidarity .
could you at least raise this with the commission and member states in the council to try and make the transitional periods as brief as possible ?
mr president , the commission 's decision concerning the commercial arrangements which ryanair has with charleroi airport is very misjudged .
it flies in the face of economic reason and is a serious blow to the development of the low-cost airline industry in europe .
ryanair has developed charleroi airport from being a deserted field to catering for over two million passengers a year .
low-cost air travel is supported by the citizens of europe .
the european commission has yet to explain clearly what it intends to do to support low-cost air travel in europe in the future .
the problem now is the lack of clarity regarding state aid for regional airports in europe .
there is now great uncertainty from the perspective of regional airports across the length and breadth of the european union with regard to how we are going to develop the low <unk> industry in the future .
the commission judgment was simply wrong and the commission has yet to explain the future policy direction for the low-cost airline sector in europe .
– mr president , both i and my colleague mr claeys put ourselves electronically on the speakers ’ list this morning for one minute each and it now appears that we are not on it .
i will ask the services to check on that , but i have been operating on a ' catch-the-eye ' system .
i do not have a list in front of me .
– mr president , i have an electronic attestation on my computer to the effect that i am registered .
i should like to recall to colleagues that we open with a system of ' catch-the-eye ' .
i do not know what the meaning is of an ' electronic communication ' , but , for future reference , wave your hands and i will try to accommodate you .
– mr president , in preparation for the chinese president ’s visit to france , the french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , has come to brussels to ask for the lifting of the arms embargo on china .
the fact is that france is dreaming about concluding lucrative contracts with beijing , which will push up its arms industry ’s turnover , and so the chinese president received an imperial welcome in france .
nothing was said about human rights ; tibet is being oppressed , but it would appear that the french president does not even know where it is .
when you have the opportunity to sell some of your friend monsieur dassault ’s mirage jet fighters , you prefer not to think about a few boring old monks .
jacques chirac , who can wax so lyrical about tolerance in his own country , evidently did not have the time to read the reports of the various human rights organisations , which , year in and year out , detail the chinese offences : censorship , arbitrary arrests , overcrowded prisons , re-education camps and the absence of free expression of opinion .
jacques chirac even managed to describe the forthcoming referendum in taiwan as an act of aggression against china .
that the european union has no option but to do business with china is something we have to be able to accept , but supplying weapons is a completely different matter .
we are therefore in full agreement with mr watson ’s statement that this arms embargo is one of the last means available to the european union , whereby it can force the communist dictatorship in china to respect human rights .
the next item is the report ( a0-0000 / 0000 ) by giorgos katiforis , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , on the role and methods of credit rating agencies ( 0000/0000 ( ini ) ) .
. mr president , the report i have the honour of presenting is an own-initiative report on credit rating agencies , which are business organisations of good standing in the markets .
however , their reputation has been shaken somewhat by the recent spate of financial scandals , starting with enron and ending with parmalat .
the parmalat fraud is especially relevant as it concerns bondholders : precisely the section of the market that rating agencies are supposed to protect .
until a few days before the crash of these companies , they were unable to do anything about protecting the public .
these failures have prompted debates in the united states , investigations in the us congress , the us securities and exchange commission , the international organization of securities commission and other international fora .
there is a specific european angle on this matter .
rating agencies that are one hundred years old in the united states are relative newcomers in europe .
in some cases they have given indications of not understanding european business mentality .
they have created friction , especially in germany .
the other point of special european interest is the inevitable remark that whatever the nature of the regulation of the agencies – however mild and indirect – it has its seat exclusively in the united states , in the form of the securities and exchange commission .
the fact that nothing similar exists in europe makes for an unbalanced transatlantic relationship which might become troublesome if it is not redressed in time .
these considerations prompted the original proposal of the report in favour of the formation of a european registration authority to be considered by the commission , an authority to which agencies would report on their activities and with which they could establish a regulatory dialogue , a dialogue of equals based on the european security ratings committee , on topics of mutual interest – excluding , of course , any intervention in the substance of the opinions issued by the agencies .
it is interesting that the securities and exchange commission has recently expressed interest in making contact with the csr on this matter .
the majority of the committee on economic and monetary affairs found this proposal too and recommended re-examining the whole area of operations of rating agencies without including in their recommendation anything as specific as the creation of a european registration authority .
with all due respect for the majority opinion of my colleagues , i beg to differ for two reasons .
firstly , because a regulatory authority operates in the united states and , secondly , because – as i have already said – the lack of a corresponding authority in europe creates a potentially harmful imbalance .
i have therefore asked my political group to help me out by resubmitting the proposal for a european registration agency in the form of an amendment , and i urge all colleagues who originally may have differed on this point to think again .
this is not a party political issue , but it is certainly a political issue because it involves the interests of europe as a whole .
the alternative is that the agencies will eventually – such is the strength of feeling in favour of some regulation of their activities – be forced to report to 00 or 00 national financial authorities in europe , something the agencies themselves must view with horror .
rating agencies must continue to do good work .
we have proposed no heavy-handed regulation , but , without a european registration agency , we will be failing to attain what is obviously our main objective .
while thanking my colleagues for supporting various other useful proposals , i urge them to think again about this .
. mr president , the european commission welcomes the european parliament 's decision to draw up a report on the role and methods of rating agencies .
i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his initiative , which is timely .
as you all know , the role of rating agencies is increasing nowadays .
in the past , credit ratings focused mainly on sovereign debt .
however , in the last decade , the role of credit ratings has become ever more crucial , with the growth of corporate bond <unk> and the inclusion of references to credit ratings in several pieces of financial legislation , including banking legislation .
besides , as everybody knows , recent major scandals have raised questions on the role of rating agencies in general : we cannot forget the enron case in 0000 , or the recent parmalat case , among others .
therefore , it is clear that it is now time to take action , as mr katiforis rightly pointed out .
there are at least four issues to be resolved regarding credit rating agencies .
first , the legal treatment of the question of access by rating agencies to inside information from issuers is currently unclear in europe .
there is no harmonised european legislation , nor even any regulation at national level .
if rating agencies are to have access to inside information from issuers , we should ensure that the same information is available to all rating agencies .
i think mr katiforis ’ report reflects this .
another solution would be to prohibit rating agencies from access to inside information from issuers , as is done in the case of financial analysts .
the second issue regarding credit rating agencies in the context of enron and parmalat concerns the level of skill of agency staff , as well as the transparency of their methodology .
it would be sensible to think about measures to tackle this issue and we clearly agree with mr katiforis on this .
with this is mind , a directive adopted by the commission last december , implementing the market abuse directive as regards fair presentation of investment recommendations , could be a good starting point .
the third issue commonly raised is the lack of competition among credit rating agencies .
in practice , the worldwide industry is nearly an oligopoly .
we therefore welcome mr katiforis ' call to promote more competition in europe .
the establishment of objective criteria for entrance or development of other players in the industry might help .
the fourth and last issue , probably the most debated , regards conflicts of interest for credit rating agencies and these take two different forms .
on the one hand , there is a suspicion that the provision of advisory services by rating agencies to companies they rate might influence the outcome of the rating process .
therefore , such advisory services should be disclosed along with the rating .
once again , the directive adopted by the commission last december , implementing the market abuse directive as regards disclosure of conflicts of interest , could be a good starting point to tackle this question .
the second conflict of interest , and the most controversial , relates to the remuneration of rating agencies by the companies they rate .
if the rating agency is paid by an issuer , rather than by subscribers , it casts doubts regarding the possibility of ' downgrade rigidity ' when ratings are updated .
this question is not new but now needs to be resolved .
we have to take action fast on these four issues .
the european commission committed itself to that at the oviedo european council in april 0000 .
we have to respect our commitment before new scandals occur .
the european commission will thus be able to take a position on the subject by the summer or autumn of 0000 at the latest .
among other contributions , mr katiforis ’ report will be an important element to guide us .
in conclusion , the question remains of what the united states is going to do on this matter .
we must be realistic .
the top two worldwide rating agencies are american .
it would be reasonable to take this into account , as mr katiforis rightly stressed .
for the moment , however , the american securities and exchange commission is silent on the subject , despite calls for changes from congress .
if the united states wants to achieve convergence with us before we adopt a position , we would appreciate having a clear view from its side on this crucial topic quickly .
we will keep you informed in due course .
– mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , and mr katiforis , whom , for a start , i warmly thank for the report on the future assessment of rating agencies .
what is this actually about ?
it is a fact that rating agencies have , in the capital market , a very great deal of power and influence over enterprises .
upgrading or – in particular – downgrading is significant for an enterprise , in that it makes for major problems with the raising of capital , financial problems , and that does of course have indirect effects on jobs .
rating agencies , though , also assess countries ; in germany , for example , they assess the federal states .
it follows that the upgrading and downgrading of german federal states has effects on the taxpayer .
i am not making this point by way of criticism , but only as an observation .
there are three rating agencies in the market ; even though i am a defender of competition and would very much welcome it if they were to be joined by more , i think that an administrative , public solution would be the wrong one .
if anything , the creation of any more rating agencies , or at any rate , of a european one , should be in response to the market , but all attempts to do so to date have been unsuccessful .
if we take into account the power that the rating agencies have , and our tendency , in legislating on financial markets , towards ever more regulation and supervision , then we have to give some thought to how we are to handle them in future .
it is for this reason that i regard mr katiforis ’ report as very important , in that it is the first in europe to give attention to this topic .
it is also important that europe should do so .
i would describe all three of the existing rating agencies as being predominantly anglo-saxon .
not that there is anything intrinsically wrong with that ; but there are , after all , different financial structures within the european union and around the world , with different rules , and not every rule that works on one side of the atlantic must likewise be <unk> the other .
that is why i see it as highly significant that we should make the attempt at the european level .
in so doing , we should not give so much attention to what the americans are doing in this field , for – after all – rating agencies also want to do business in this part of the world .
all this we have to consider in the context of basel ii , in which rating – whether internal or external – will increasingly apply in the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises .
it will become normal , and the quintessential difference between external and internal rating will be that internal rating will , in the member states , be subject to financial supervision , whereas external rating will not .
what is at issue is whether we can carry on in future with only internal rating being supervised , while external rating is not .
my main reason for raising this point is that i am told , by people in industry and in the financial sector , that businesses themselves find it very difficult to get the relevant information about their own rating , so one can scarcely speak in terms of a normal customer relationship between enterprises and rating firms .
this makes it important that we should now demand that the commission should analyse this issue , do some work on it , say precisely how things currently stand , and make proposals .
that is why i very largely share mr katiforis ’ concerns .
the outcome should , however , be left open ; we should not already be calling for registration and supervision , which can be left to the end of the process .
we can , though , aim to get the rating agencies to give an undertaking , which would include a commitment to transparency , and which the commission should take as a basis for its work .
this process could well involve the rating agencies making their own proposals .
i regard it as a matter of urgency – as does the group of the european people ’s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats – that we should get this process underway now , that we should monitor it with a critical eye , and that the commission should submit its proposals in the middle of next year .
mr president , commissioner diamantopoulou , mr katiforis , well done on this initiative , well done on the content of this report .
i believe that it comes at an important time .
whenever people try to take on board that ‘ macro ’ thinking of ours which we defend point by point , in particular in the committee on economic and monetary affairs , one thing that occasionally strikes them is the gap that sometimes exists – and which i am grateful for your having to some extent highlighted , commissioner – between , on the one hand , the social model we claim to embody and , on the other hand , the standards we employ and the specific work we are involved in .
if we are to talk about rating agencies and if we are to be delighted with our rapporteur ’s initiative , it is because the market is blind and because , in this blindness , rating agencies have obtained , or are obtaining , an altogether essential decision-making power that will have far-reaching consequences for the future of enterprises and , therefore , of jobs .
in view of this , i would like to make three remarks .
the first is that what we say here cannot be seen as separate from the global debate on corporate governance .
what type of corporate governance do we want for our social model in europe ?
what division of roles between capital and labour do we want ?
what role should redistribution have ?
these are the questions that we should answer by way of the solutions that we envisage for the operation of these agencies in particular , but not only for these agencies .
i remember the debates that we had on the issue of accounting standards , and we are seeing the wayward effects of the so-called autonomy of the iasb .
i do not want the same thing to happen to us where rating agencies are concerned .
my second remark is that if , in europe , we want the improvement in the operation of rating agencies to contribute to protecting our social model , then we cannot leave aside the issue of corporate social responsibility .
in this area too , agencies are now coming into being . they are european initiatives .
i am thinking , in particular , of mrs nicole <unk> ’s agency in france , <unk> .
these are complementary developments that we should reflect upon .
finally , my third remark , commissioner , is an expression of regret at not having heard your opinion on the amendment , proposed by our rapporteur and to be fully supported both by myself and my group , in favour of establishing european registering and regulatory agencies .
mr president , firstly i would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work on this issue . it is topical and mr katiforis has brought great insight into this issue .
i am particularly grateful that he has taken on a number of the concerns i expressed in my amendments .
i hope that a deal may be reached between the ppe-de group and the rapporteur .
that has not proved possible – so far – but i am sure there is a great deal in his report that we very much support .
in a slightly shock reversal of the normal roles within the ppe-de group , i found that the rest of my group were more cautious about the idea of further regulation than i was : usually i am the one in my group arguing for a more deregulatory approach .
what is very important – and it was stated clearly by mr radwan , the shadow rapporteur – is that yes , this is an important issue ; yes , questions need to be answered about how ratings agencies work and yes , questions need to be asked about whether we should have a registration scheme for ratings agencies .
the conclusion the group came to was that we should not prejudge the outcome of this process .
it is important that members of parliament and committees look carefully at the issues raised by mr katiforis in his report , but we do not want to prejudge the outcome and say at this point that yes , we should have a european registration authority .
we in this group are wary of the cost of regulation .
we are concerned about what a significant step it would be to bring rating agencies within a regulatory framework or a registration scheme , and we must be cautious in our response to recent financial scandals .
there is a tendency among some financial commentators to assume that we must have further regulation following parmalat , and the organisations that are most squarely in the frame for further regulation and registration are rating agencies .
we should look objectively and calmly at what happened at parmalat and see what response is necessary so as to avoid any hasty or knee-jerk reactions , because it is difficult to see how changing the scheme or regulation for rating agencies could have prevented the parmalat scandal .
there will always be people who are prepared to break the law , as they were at parmalat , and no matter how wide-ranging and effective the scheme of regulation , whether it be for hedge funds or rating agencies or whatever else , we are not going to prevent that kind of criminal conduct .
we can try and make it happen less often , but it is impossible to prevent .
questions have to be asked about rating agencies and how they function , but it is premature to reach the conclusion that further regulation or a registration scheme are necessarily needed at this stage .
– mr president , i can tell mrs villiers that we should not , at any rate , be saying that we do not know what we are asking for or what we want .
it is unfortunate that the work done by the committee on economic and monetary affairs has left us with little of the original draft report – little , that is , that would demand greater transparency of the rating agencies , and require that they be monitored more closely .
now , in the aftermath of global financial scandals ranging from worldcom to parmalat is surely the time for rating agencies to be registered and their practices monitored .
in view of basel ii ’s recognition of external rating , and of the consequences resulting from it , the message we are giving now to the commission is not a matter for indifference .
this report takes a tolerant view of an oligopoly that is almost impossible to monitor , one that is quite contrary to all the practices of the internal market .
of the hundred largest enterprises in the european union , 00 are monitored by only three agencies , which should , therefore , be able to do a better job of rating them .
the information used to produce an assessment is also important when deciding where to invest .
this is where we cannot lag behind current developments in the usa , where , only recently , serious problems resulted in the existing system of rating agency supervision , which is in the hands of the securities and exchange commission , being substantially tightened up .
i am sorry to have to tell mr katiforis that the signal this own-initiative report sends to the commission is too moderate and gives us too little cause to hope that we will end up with a trustworthy instrument .
i will nonetheless conclude by endorsing his appeal that , in view of the many current uncertainties , we should explore every avenue whereby a european registration authority may be established .
– mr president , commissioner , mr katiforis , ladies and gentlemen , this report and this issue are of particular significance in view of the many questions that are being raised .
previous speakers have already shown you how the rating agencies have gained twofold significance – on the one hand as a result of notorious scandals , and on the other as a result of the consumer credit directive or the development of basel ii .
let us be frank , and admit that every customer of a bank , and certainly anyone taking out a loan , is the subject of some form of rating process .
above all , rating agencies assess companies and countries .
these evaluations lead to debates on the level of interest rates , the amount of equity capital and the stock exchange prices ; they also have an effect on customers ’ confidence in the business and country in question .
it also , of course , follows that we have to bear in mind that the whole philosophy behind rating agencies is largely of anglo-saxon origin and that there are three large firms in this field that carry out ratings – major and significant ones – in europe too .
that being so , we also have to consider the fact that all these rating agencies possess a quality mark – an american one awarded by <unk> and exchange commission .
if , then , we are to talk in terms of more competition , we need not only european agencies , but also a quality mark , for some kind of quality mark has the natural effect of building confidence and enhancing the agency ’s value in the market .
we therefore want to put the case for europe ’s rating agencies to be promoted and for them to respond specifically to the characteristics and needs of small and medium-sized enterprises .
we want to advocate the introduction of a european quality mark , or , best of all , a global one , to accompany basel ii , and we want a debate on internal and external rating .
we favour freedom of opinion and the agencies ’ independence , and we want greater transparency .
that is why i regard it as intolerable that there should be no licensing procedure whatever for rating agencies .
it may be that starting with financial market supervision , and with equal treatment for internal and external ratings so that agencies can be registered , that is to say , authorised , is a good approach that we should adopt , instead of creating new authorities .
mr president , i too wish to offer my praise for this report .
it is an excellent initiative and i , like most members of this house who have spoken , hope that we will be able , in the course of proceedings , specifically in plenary , to make mr katiforis ’s original philosophy a reality .
as mr katiforis stated , the crux of the issue at stake today , regarding this own-initiative report , is whether or not the activities of the rating agencies should be regulated and if so , whether such regulation should take place at national or european level .
as the rapporteur suggested in his explanatory statement , this is clearly a political decision , and this debate clearly bears out this view .
however , the rapporteur was initially unquestionably in favour of regulation , and regulation at european level , even though voices closely associated with the sector have been raised against such a move .
representatives of the sector appreciate that their activities form part of the sphere of economic information and that what is at stake , therefore , is to guarantee complete freedom for such economic information .
the need for information is obviously not incompatible with the needs and interests of regulation and while it has to be admitted that rating agencies have , by and large , performed <unk> under the current system , it is also clear that we face new problems today – and there have been some spectacular examples of these , as members who spoke before me have already mentioned – that require new solutions and probably a new system .
moreover , there is no doubt that the rapporteur ’s options are in line with the legislative approach adopted by the eu within the framework of financial services .
to my mind , it is therefore in the public interest to establish bodies to regulate credit rating , especially because , as we all know , the outcome of this activity already has a decisive impact on the legitimacy and eligibility of certain financial assets for certain types of application used by the general public .
consequently , i feel that the rapporteur ’s first initiative , which was not accepted in its entirety by the committee on economic and monetary affairs , must be endorsed and supported by plenary .
it is extremely bold , yet completely justified .
mr president , it was a very interesting discussion and it is obvious that this is a hot political and economic issue .
members discussed many questions .
i would particularly like to underline the discussion on regulation : whether this regulation concerns only transparency and criteria of transparency or whether it should be more binding .
then there is the interesting issue of an independent authority , what kind of entity that would be and whether we should agree to establish it at european level .
another major issue is the registration of these companies and whether they have to be registered at european or at national level .
the commission agrees with many of the points the katiforis report has made , but it will present its final position at the end of spring or at the latest in autumn .
i would like to thank mr katiforis again for his very interesting contribution .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow from 00.00 a.m. .
the next item is the debate on the report ( a0-0000 / 0000 ) by mr cercas , on behalf of the committee on employment and social affairs , on the organisation of working time ( revision of directive 00/000/eec ) ( 0000/0000 ( ini ) ) .
. mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the main aim of my report is to examine two articles of council directive 00/000/ec on certain aspects of the organisation of working time .
this important directive was approved ten years ago in order to regulate certain factors which are essential to the health and safety of salaried workers , such as daily rest periods and holidays .
the directive also indicates the maximum weekly working time of 00 hours , although it allows it to be calculated as an average over a reference period of four months .
the approval of this important directive – which is one of the most important in community social legislation – was not a straightforward process .
the resistance of the united kingdom was only overcome by the court of justice and , for ten years , we had to have two temporary exceptions with regard to the reference period for calculation of the 00 weekly hours , and with regard to the application of the 00 hours weekly working time in those countries that want to implement this exception if the workers wish , provided that this wish is expressed freely and reliably : this is what is known as individual opting-out .
the commission and the council should have re-examined these temporary exceptions before 00 november last year .
regrettably , however , the commission did not communicate its analyses or proposals by that date .
up until 00 december 0000 it did not present us with any communication nor open up a consultation period , and furthermore its text lacks specific proposals on the trickiest issues .
what the commission has done – and we should thank it – has been to commission a study by the university of cambridge – carried out by barnard , <unk> and <unk> – on the way opting-out has been used in the country which approved it , in other words , the united kingdom .
this report provides us with in-depth knowledge of the negative consequences of its widespread use and abuse in a labour market in which it has been applied in a generalised manner .
my report refers exclusively to the re-examination of these two exceptions in order to respond not with waffle , but with clarity , to the question the directive obliges us to ask : 00 years after its adoption , does it make sense to maintain the extension of the reference periods ?
does it make sense to maintain the principle that it is possible not to apply the maximum 00 hours by means of individual opting out ?
i say in my report that both questions must be answered in light of the principles which governed the adoption of the directive : the health and safety of workers .
these must be accompanied by a third : flexibility , as indicated by the commission in its communication .
we must ensure that the professional and family lives of europeans are reconciled .
my proposals are also clear .
according to our objective information , there is no reason to abrogate the extension of the reference periods which have proven to be useful and have not , at least for the moment , had serious consequences for the health and safety of workers , but on the other hand , there is overwhelming evidence that opting-out seriously jeopardises minimum health and safety rights , and seriously jeopardises the reconciliation of family and professional life .
the debate and the vote within the committee on employment and social affairs have been very tough .
i hope that tomorrow we can continue working and bringing positions closer together .
i personally have maintained an open attitude to the element of flexibility , also with regard to the problem of the duty hours of doctors which has been introduced into this debate .
i have been flexible , just as the directive is flexible .
now , i have always stated , and i will do so until the end , that individual opting-out sets extremely dangerous precedents : minimum rights , mr president , are inalienable .
if today workers are being obliged or allowed to surrender basic rights , such as maximum hours , tomorrow , on the basis of the same argument , they could be allowed to surrender other essential elements of their health and safety , to work in environments in which they suffer noise , dust , the removal of protective barriers at work sites , to surrender maternity rights and many other things .
and all in the name of individual freedom , which disappears when it is applied .
it is a horrendous precedent .
i will end , mr president , by saying that our charter of fundamental rights and article 000 of the treaty oblige us to resist the wishes of those who do not want european rules .
opting-out is not a flexible rule : it is the absence of rules .
by allowing basic minimum rights legislation not to be applied to someone , we would be advocating the absence of rules .
i hope that all members of this house will give this full consideration .
we cannot offer victory to people who do not want the social europe to be built , to those allergic to minimum rules , which workers on our continent have enjoyed for more than a century .
mr president , i must thank mr cercas for his excellent report in connection with the revision of a directive which is one of the foundation stones of community labour law .
as we have heard , the main objective of this directive , which is also both its political framework and its legal basis , is to protect workers from the harmful effects on their health and safety from working excessively long hours , inadequate rest or irregular working hours .
the directive is in fact a framework of minimum health and safety requirements as regards daily and weekly rest , the maximum working week , annual paid leave and the length of night shifts .
of course , we must not overlook the fact that , although the legal framework is the health and safety of workers , it also relates directly to the productivity of enterprises .
enterprises which have workers without these minimum acceptable limits clearly cannot achieve the required productivity .
the commission , as required due to the expiry of the ten-year period from publication of the directive , presented its report on 00 december and announced the revision of the working time directive .
the commission , taking account of the manner in which this directive was implemented in the 00 member states , is obliged to evaluate two provisions in this directive .
first , the derogations regarding reference periods and how the maximum working week is calculated .
mr cercas questioned if we need to debate this matter , which has not created any particular problems .
however , we have numerous branches which have problems and which would be interested in a different reference period and this has translated into proposals and discussions by both employers and employees .
secondly , the possibility of individual exceptions from the maximum working time , the famous ' opting out ' .
of course , these two issues cannot be addressed without taking account of recent developments in the case law of the european court of justice , which qualifies the time which a doctor is at home on call as working time , insofar as he is called to the health centre during the period he is at home .
consequently , the commission communication expressly concerns itself with the results of these judicial cases .
we cannot look at the two provisions which need to be revised without taking account of the ruling of the courts .
this is an extremely complicated issue which , as you too emphasise in your report , requires detailed evaluation of any repercussions of this change of legislation .
that is why the commission has started a broad consultation procedure .
at the same time , we are asking for the opinion of the social partners within a special framework of procedures , as laid down in the treaty , and we are already in the first stage of consultations in accordance with article 000 of the treaty .
i must stress here that , according to the treaty , the role of the social partners is very different , it is independent , and the framework within which the commission is starting the debate cannot but be broad and the first approach cannot result in directions set by the commission , because the social partners themselves must consult in the first and second stages , so that we have their positions .
that is why i would say , as you will have observed , that this first communication has a fairly general framework .
nonetheless , there are various points on which i think we are fairly clear and which i support .
the first is that we cannot but have a careful analysis and evaluation of the repercussions and consequences of any change , first , on workers , because on questions of health and safety there can be no compromises , and secondly , on the functioning of enterprises .
secondly , we need to address the matter in all its aspects .
it is , as we said , a fundamental directive for labour law and we must categorically avoid any exclusively sectoral approach .
of course , this does not mean that we must not take account of various important problems , such as in the field of health which , following the rulings by the court , could be extended to other branches with similar problems .
the third point is the correlation between working time and equal opportunities .
this is an innate link which exists in the directive which , essentially , helps encourage the member states to take measures which improve compatibility between working and family life .
the fourth point concerns ' opting out ' .
there are various types of approach .
i would say there are two extremes , the first being that we have no facility to opt out of the maximum working time , in other words we completely abolish ' opting out ' , and the second being that we generalise ' opting out ' . this generalisation would , essentially , leave employers and employees the facility to decide on working times and the entire employment framework .
both extreme views create significant problems : the first takes no account of the special characteristics of branches , of a large number of branches and , more importantly , of the special characteristics which might arise from rulings such as that by the court , with very serious consequences in the specific case of health systems .
if there are also rulings of this type in other branches in the future , then other branches will have similar problems .
the second extreme position , which concerns overall acceptance of ' opting out ' as a way of operating the job market , essentially abolishes all the fundamental frameworks of the european union based on workers ' rights which essentially take account of health and safety and which link productivity with the worker as a person .
i would say from the outset that i am opposed to both these extreme approaches .
of course , we must accept that the institutional framework which the directive in question had for ' opting out ' allowed for it to be abused .
that is also why there are countries in which we have systematic abuse of ' opting out ' in all branches , in all categories of enterprise , with very serious problems for the workers .
i therefore think that we should see and resolve these basic outstanding issues , taking account , on the one hand , of the need to use ' opting out ' and , on the other hand , of the existence of new criteria and binding positions on the member states , so that there is control of their use and not their abuse .
because this directive is clearly of very great importance and affects the job market and the economy and has a direct impact on the lives of millions of workers in europe and , at the same time , on enterprises and the economy of europe , we need real , substantial consultation with all the agencies involved and , of course , as we said , with the social partners .
our objective is for this procedure to bring us to a better legislative framework which takes account of the real impact on the job market and best serves the basic objective of the directive , which is to protect the health and safety of workers .
i think that parliament has the first word in this consultation process .
your report is extremely topical and material .
i would like to assure you that it is the basis for preparations and , of course , is only the commission 's first debate and approach with parliament .
over all the coming months we shall have the opportunity for constant debate and exchanges of opinion , so that we take account of your particular positions .
mr president , i wish to begin by congratulating the commissioner and thanking her for her wise , practical and helpful comments today and also for the report by the commission , which was extremely well balanced .
i mean no disrespect to the rapporteur , and i hope he will forgive me for saying that i cannot make the same comments about his own report .
as he knows , together with the eldr group , we nearly managed to defeat it in committee , but virtually none of our amendments were accepted .
yet they so nearly won through and , had we succeeded , we would not have had to trouble the house on this occasion .
needless to say , we are retabling those amendments and we hope that the full house will do justice to them in the vote on wednesday .
the sad thing about the report was that essentially it stated in black and white that there should be no opt-out at all under any circumstances and that the uk should be taken to court for alleged abuses , as if to say : my mind is made up , do not confuse me with the facts .
i would like to share some facts with the house this evening .
opting out from the working time directive is voluntary : nobody can legally be forced to sign an opt-out and it is important to give people the flexibility to work longer hours and earn the overtime if they wish .
research in the uk has indicated that 0.0 million people work longer than the maximum hours stated in the directive , but two thirds of them get paid for the extra hours so would lose out if the opt-out were removed .
it is true that some workers would like to work fewer hours , but not if the cut in hours means a drop in pay .
more than seven out of ten of those working longer hours said they would not want fewer hours if it meant less pay .
there is that health and safety have been compromised in any of these circumstances .
i would now just like to talk briefly about the report by barnard , <unk> and <unk> , which the rapporteur referred to .
he stated that , according to its conclusions , there have been abuses on a massive scale .
i have to say that the conclusions say nothing of the kind .
it was interesting that , when the commission report itself came out , there was an article in the on tuesday , 0 january , co-authored by catherine barnard and simon <unk> , professing surprise at the way their report had been misinterpreted .
i would just like to quote three short paragraphs . ' it is true that we did uncover evidence of some abuses of the opt-out system .
sometimes , the opt-out was presented as a standard contract term to new staff , which they would have to take positive steps to avoid .
but this was unusual .
what was striking was that , for every employee who felt under pressure to opt out , we found others who wanted the right to choose what hours they worked and what salary , status and job satisfaction they gained as a result ( ... ) .
we quickly discovered a gap between the rhetoric around reducing working hours and the reality of working life for many people .
in one example given to us , workers in the tobacco industry could lose hundreds of pounds a week in overtime pay if they were limited to working 00 hours . '
they state in the final paragraph that ' a complete ban on long hours would be unfeasible in many companies and industries or would be simply disregarded . '
those are the facts , not as presented by the rapporteur .
therefore the conclusion has to be that the opt-out must stay and abuses , if any , must go .
i would hope that members on all sides of the house could support that .
finally , i would just mention the simap and jaeger judgments .
they are the important issues we should be addressing and our amendments try to focus on those issues , because we have to try to resolve the very clear problems that the court of justice has raised .
in conclusion , i know that on the record in september uk labour meps said that they voted unanimously against retaining the opt-out , but it is never too late to repent .
i still cherish the hope that on wednesday they will vote with us in the interests both of employment and employees .
mr president , i congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent work on the organisation of working time .
as the commissioner said , this is an issue which touches every worker and family within the european union .
however , although i clearly understand that individual commissioners do not always get what they want when they want it , i am very disappointed with the way the issue of working time has been handled by the commission as a whole .
it had ten years to prepare and produce proposals on the operation of derogations on the opt-out and annualisation ; the review and communication were clearly required by november 0000 and yet , incredibly , the commission still managed to miss the deadline .
when the communication came , it was , quite frankly , hardly worth the paper it was printed on .
it is a weak document and gives no clear signal on the best direction for action .
it should not , in my opinion , be allowed to stand as a proper instrument for the opening of the first phase of consultation between the social partners under the procedure included in article 000 .
i hope the social partners will make that clear .
also , by the time the commission got around to producing the communication , it was being bombarded with notifications from member states that they would begin to use the opt-out in their health-care sectors in response to the simap and jaeger rulings .
no doubt some member states were being opportunistic in this respect , but the commission had had three years to react to simap ; its inaction could therefore lead to the <unk> of a central piece of eu health and safety law .
in our view , a blanket spread in the use of the opt-out is not the answer to simap and jaeger .
we want speedy and specific action from the commission in response to those judgments and then time to sensibly revise other provisions in the original directive .
as to how we solve those difficulties , we could look to social partner agreements or <unk> arrangements that have been put in place in certain parts of the eu to deal with the implications of those cases .
or we could look at the type of definition we adopted to cover the case of relief drivers and overnight ferry <unk> dealing with working time for drivers .
as well as working time and rest time the notion of periods of availability was included there .
more generally , people like mr bushill-matthews are constantly telling me that the opt-out is essential to give companies the flexibility they need to operate .
it is strange then , in my view , that until recently only one member state used this opt-out : the others were managing just fine and would still be managing in their health-care sectors if not for the simap and jaeger judgments .
the truth is that the directive is flexible .
more relaxed arrangements apply to a whole range of occupations and activities and the reference periods are generous .
i for one would also be quite happy to look at whether annualisation of working time could be made a more realistic option in all member states .
overall , the socialist group takes the view that an opt-out from a health and safety directive is a dangerous nonsense .
the possibility was created for purely political reasons ten years ago and it was a bad idea from the start .
a general opt-out is bad for the welfare of workers , bad for a proper work-life balance , damaging to efforts to encourage women to return to the labour market and , as the statistics show , not at all helpful in the drive to boost productivity .
it is not the direction a union committed to transforming itself into the most dynamic , knowledge-based economy in the world should even think of taking .
so i , for one , will not repent and i will certainly not join mr bushill-matthews on wednesday .
mr president , i am pleased that the commission brought forward the consultation document .
it would have been useful , however , to have brought it forward before mr cercas drew up the report , but i am very pleased that we were able to table oral amendments .
nevertheless this is not the ideal way of working and i would like to register that point .
i tabled a number of amendments , a lot of them with the ppe-de group , and some of my own .
the main point – and i am very pleased the commissioner touched on this – is that the individual opt-out should be kept , but that it should be truly voluntary and measures should be taken to tackle any abuse .
but as mr bushill-matthews said , that abuse is not as widespread in the uk as the rapporteur leads us to believe .
indeed , as mr bushill-matthews and the rapporteur have repeatedly said , the authors of the research – barnard , <unk> and <unk> – stated that the abuse was widespread .
those people have distanced themselves from what you have written in your report and indeed would distance themselves from your statement today .
to answer mr hughes ' point , one of the reasons for maintaining the opt-out is that in the uk we do not have collective agreements .
that is one of the main reasons we use the opt-out .
other member states use derogations because they have collective agreements .
decisions can be made between both sides of industry : trade unions and employers will get together and decide what they want to do on the working time directive .
but because we do not have that – at least not to any great extent – we need the flexibility for our businesses to be able to cope .
wages are not a competence of the eu , nor should they be .
we should not be discussing pay .
but workers in the uk are on low wages , even though we have a national minimum wage .
they quite often add to their <unk> pay by doing overtime .
if we get rid of the opt-out , there will be many cases of workers not being able to do overtime and therefore not getting a reasonable pay level .
we are not the only country that uses it either : germany , france , the netherlands , spain and luxembourg are all either using it or going to use it in the health or catering industries .
another problem is the length of reference period .
tourism and agriculture have a particular problem because of different working patterns and because of the times of year that they work .
the commission must also look at the simap and jaeger judgments .
it is very important that we do that on health and come forward with proposals .
i hope enough meps will join us tomorrow when we vote , in particular those labour meps who voted against us in committee and against the uk labour government .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , commissioner , as we know , this 0000 directive , which lays down minimum conditions governing the organisation of working time , with a view to ensuring a high level of health and safety for workers , should have been transposed into national law by 0000 , establishing the possibility of limited derogation .
the truth of the matter is that various member states have used and abused these derogations and have not complied with the provisions therein , especially the upper limit of working time in sectors such as health , and the hotel and catering industries .
once again , now that the seven-year deadline has elapsed , the commission has regrettably given no clear signal as to how the problems that have come to light are to be solved .
hence my endorsement of most of the proposals contained in the cercas report , in particular the provision of an amended directive resolving existing problems and ensuring a higher level of health and safety protection for workers .
i also welcome the comparison study on the repercussions of long working hours on the family and on health , and the effect on both sexes . a further welcome proposal is the provision of protection for freelance workers and others whose safety is endangered by workers exhausted from working such long hours .
the court of justice has ruled in a number of cases , and has included time spent on call as working time , thereby confirming the fundamental principle that time not entirely available to workers due to work commitments must be regarded as working time .
i congratulate mr cercas on the work he has carried out and , as he states in his report , derogations in the form of individual opt-out clauses must be scrapped and we must work towards reducing the pressures and eliminating the abuses that undermine family life .
my group , the confederal group of the european united left , has tabled proposals that would enable us to extend these rights a little further .
we have called for a revision of the directive , initially reducing the maximum working week from 00 to 00 hours ; and for a gradual reduction in the working week to 00 hours , over the course of the next seven years .
we hope that this would lead to further reductions in working time and a redistribution of work in the member states , which are effective ways of reconciling family and professional life , of promoting equal rights for women and of combating unemployment .
lastly , i deplore the fact that the group of the european people ’s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats persists in disparaging the report approved by the committee on employment and social affairs , which only serves to show that they are perfectly happy to perpetuate an unacceptable state of affairs that undermines effective health and safety protection of workers .
you can therefore be sure that we shall be voting against these proposals , as we did in the committee on employment and social affairs .
– mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , although we have kept afloat in somewhat <unk> waters , i do think it quite worthy of comment that the debate is being dominated by a number of speakers from the united kingdom .
this is something with which we are not wholly unfamiliar and to which i shall return shortly .
i want to start by thanking our rapporteur for having drafted an outstanding report .
everyone knows how narrow the vote was in our committee , and that it could have had a different result , so the commission is aware of the differing views that exist in this house .
we , though , have to look at each of them very carefully .
this own-initiative report was nevertheless a necessary one .
we actually wanted to talk about amendments to the directive , of which , as i see it , there is without a doubt a great need .
i shall also be putting forward arguments as to why this is the case .
to be sure , the commission has taken its time , and this is where i endorse mr hughes ’ comments on the communication with which we have been presented .
the material available to us and the study as published are enlightening , but they are not normative .
those who have dealt with this for some time actually knew what this was about .
yet again , as i see it , the actual blame for this rests with the member states rather than with the commission .
a number of member states are engaging in delaying tactics to gain the temporary support of the others in a while , such as the accession countries , which also may well be advocates of weakening necessary regulation .
there are , of course also , and not least the employers , and , above all , there is all the heavy lobbying that is going on at the moment .
as recently as last thursday lunchtime , i was phoned up by the british social security minister , who asked me what i , for god ’s sake , thought i was doing by signing up to a few pertinent amendments .
i really do think that is going a bit far .
i am pleased that he wanted to approach me , but i am doing no deals by the by , especially as that would mean bypassing the problems that exist .
let me start with the general individual opt-out .
the question we have to ask ourselves is whether we want , at european level , social minimum rules , especially on highly topical matters where even the ilo – in 0000 , i think – said that 00 hours is enough ?
do we want a minimum regime ?
do we want these rules to be a means of protecting safety and health , or do we want to move towards a situation that is slowly starting to take shape and which i would describe as social policy competition among member states ?
that , at the moment , is what this is all about .
let me give you one example .
at the moment – and the dutch council of ministers is also represented here – discussions are going on in the netherlands about adjusting dutch legislation on working hours along the lines of the european minimum regime .
that is to say , in the netherlands too , it is proposed that the 00 hours should no longer be a matter for consultation , but should be a norm .
that is certainly going a long way .
i know that this debate is going on in other countries as well , and i do not think that we can leave it to the social partners .
on this issue , their advice may be sought , but such advice must not be <unk> in the way that several amendments on this point propose .
i will deal very briefly with workers on call , a problem that we should try to resolve .
although i am happy with the commission ’s proposals , there is a great deal left to be done ; not only as regards doctors , but also as regards firefighters – and i could say the same of a number of other services .
this is an issue that is generating a lot of heat in certain member states .
as far as i am concerned , we have to be prompt and unambiguous in our dealings with each of them .
i urge the irish and the dutch to give their full attention to this thorny problem , which , within the life of this parliament , we will probably no longer be dealing with in the form of an amended directive .
mr president , i have always considered this directive to be an infringement of workers ' rights to work the hours they wish , believing that it is an inalienable right of the individual to chose one 's own balance between work and leisure time .
the legislation was ill-conceived and did not take into consideration the difficulties experienced by small businessmen and by many professions .
it is essential that the opt-out be retained , in particular for certain occupations .
in the united kingdom , the national health service could not run without the willingness of dedicated doctors and nursing staff to work long hours .
in this regard it is imperative to remove the farcical rule that says that a doctor is working when he is asleep in bed purely because , technically , he is on call – but then , common sense is not a capability that this parliament often utilises .
the current opt-out is open to all member states .
the fact that france , germany and the netherlands are now following the uk 's example in deploying it in relation to the medical professions serves to demonstrate that the line the uk has always taken is the practical one .
with enlargement around the corner , some consideration must be given as to how this directive will affect the newcomers ' individual labour markets .
in my own experience when visiting malta last year , the leading topic for all political parties was the working time directive .
the majority of people in malta work in excess of 00 hours per week and need to do so for their own benefit and for the island 's economy .
all member states need the flexibility to organise their own working time .
the eu should recognise this and return this responsibility to national governments .
– if i may put mr titford ’s mind at rest , the dutch government is not following the united kingdom ’s example ; it is in fact dealing with another problem , one with which we are also concerning ourselves today .
on the one hand , it is very irritating that this house is virtually turning into a sort of house of commons , in that we are now giving our attention solely to problems that are in fact not even specific to the uk , but are specifically english .
that , of course , becomes very tiresome , especially for those participants in the debate who do not originate from that country .
there is also the second problematic aspect , namely the legal cases referred to earlier : the jaeger case and others .
this is where i really do think that the commission has not shown sufficient leadership .
it ought to have been apparent that the combination of the interpretation of these legal acts and the existence of the opt-out would create difficulties and to the objectives of the directive being undermined .
it waited a long time and gave what were in fact wholly inadequate answers as to what the solution might be .
not to mention such other things as , for example , the people who then think they too can use this for their own purposes by , contrary to what the directive intended , creating more difficulties .
that can happen at any time and it is at that point that the whole thing starts to unravel .
this is where i differ from many others in my belief that we have to be quick .
the fact is that we have to give priority to dealing with the points that are relevant to hospitals , the fire service and a few more of the sort of things that are relevant not only to the united kingdom ; then we will be able to talk about the opt-out .
that is , at the moment , still inadequately expressed in our report and it is certainly inadequately expressed in what the commission is saying .
it is still doing no more than creating options , which seems to indicate that we have a very long process ahead of us , but , at the time , all the member states resolved to avail themselves of the opt-out , so you never know what is going to happen .
in conclusion , i myself think an opt-out is always a sign of failure , of your inability to completely sort matters out , which is also the underlying problem here .
i still think that we have to be looking for alternatives to the opt-out , but you cannot say that you cannot get rid of it unless you offer alternatives .
if you have no alternative , you cannot say that the opt-out is wrong .
you have to say , ‘ the opt-out is wrong , but here are the alternatives to it ’ .
that is what we actually have to work towards with this report .
we will certainly have to aspire to it in the course of further consultation .
first , though , we have to close the loophole in the directive as quickly as possible , or in the place where at least the member states think it is .
then we will , in any case , have all the member states behind us – with the exception of the united kingdom , but including , i am sure , the member states in eastern europe .
we can then take a look at the last part of the second opt-out .
– mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to address a number of remarks by previous speakers relating to firms ’ need for leeway and room to manoeuvre , and to their productivity .
what we are talking about here is not rules on 00-hour or 00-hour weeks , but the option that exists in certain member states of a week of 00 or more hours .
i have to say that i regard this opting-out arrangement as absolutely absurd .
figures like that belong in the nineteenth century ; i am convinced that the productivity of our businesses is not dependent on them and that they will not make us the most modern and the most efficient economic region in europe .
what matters most of all to businesses is the options available for machinery ’s <unk> and operating times , rather than any unnecessary extension of working time .
businesses care about modern forms of labour organisation .
in fact , germany is a good example of how the social partners can be involved in the shared development of modern types of employment , organisation of work and working times .
i might add that it is this that has enabled us to lead the world in the export field .
let it also be said that the figures , data and times currently under discussion do not seem to take account of the possibility of workers having such things as children and families .
who , after all , is capable of being away from home for 00 , 00 or more hours in a week ?
i might remind you that the working times directive was meant , as one of its objectives , to be an instrument for reconciling work and family life .
mr pronk said something very good about the opt-out , namely that it has actually failed .
had it been a derogation with a limited lifespan , nothing could have been said against it .
now , though , in the meantime , there are several countries that want to adopt this british model , and it is unfortunate that these include germany , the netherlands , spain , and most of the accession countries that will be joining us on 0 may .
i doubt that the commissioner will often have come across so much public approval as there has been as a result of the rulings of the european court of justice in connection with hospital doctors .
it is , for this reason , vital that we counteract every tendency to hand these things back to the national level .
it is in this area that european social policy is under scrutiny , as are guaranteed european standards , for if we make it possible for these matters to be handed back to the national level , you can be sure that the same thing will happen in many other cases in the life of the next parliament .
in order to nip that sort of thing in the bud , we want the precise legal framework , which you have promised us .
we are happy to go along with that , but let there be no turning back !
mr president , it is approximately a hundred years since the labour movement in europe demanded statutory working time .
eight hours ’ work , eight hours ’ leisure time and eight hours ’ sleep were what were then demanded .
gradually , that programme was implemented . it was important in many ways , because it meant that companies stopped competing on the basis of working time .
they had to compete in other areas instead . it also meant that workers were protected and that society was given a fixed framework for work , schooling , leisure and other activities .
i am really shocked that the group of the european people ’s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , together with several other political groups , seem to want to break with this tradition and , instead , go back to the situation that existed a hundred years ago when a voluntary ethos prevailed in the labour market .
i note that there is no talk of voluntary agreements between trade unions and employers ’ organisations . instead , the talk is of voluntary agreements between individual employees and individual employers .
that is a retrograde step that is incomprehensible .
i do not understand how people can argue in that way or put forward a proposal along those lines .
it is deeply irresponsible and will lead to strife and conflict in the labour markets .
in a labour market so exposed to competition , it will lead to a situation in which people are forced to take jobs on the conditions that apply .
call it voluntary or involuntary , but the fact is that , in a labour market exposed to competition , people may expect to have a pre-determined market value .
they have to take what is on offer .
so much for matters being voluntary .
as many have said , family life is also affected .
parents are forced to work hours that make it difficult to combine work and family life and take care of their children .
i also want to add that all of us , as consumers , are affected .
this has not been emphasised so much , but we are in danger , for example , of being injured when we are operated on by exhausted surgeons or of being run over when we encounter lorry drivers that are half asleep . we are all victims of stress and of pressure at work .
it would be much better for all parties if we could agree to put an end to these opt-outs obtained by the united kingdom at the time when the directive was adopted .
in actual fact , they were contrary to the rule concerning competition under equal conditions .
now , employers in other countries are saying , ‘ if the united kingdom can have opt-outs , we too want opt-outs . ’ this will lead to the exception becoming the rule .
that is not something we can live with . we must therefore call a halt and instead go down the opposite route .
we must remove the united kingdom ’s opt-out and find other ways of solving these flexibility problems , for we cannot cope successfully without labour legislation that is applicable across the board .
mr president , i welcome this report and i welcome the commission 's public consultation on it .
for those who are interested , the details are on the website .
if we are honest we all know the problems that long hours of work bring for health and safety , productivity and social relationships , both for the individual and within the family .
a number of member states , for example , are very concerned about children being left without appropriate adult care at times while their parents and carers are at work .
we know that the ' long hours ' culture , for whatever reason , brings strain , stress and potential breakdown .
i find myself in the interesting position of agreeing with mr hughes this evening , and certainly with most of what mr pronk said , about the ' on call ' issue being <unk> , between social partners , in various sectors and in other ways .
the issue about who owns your time , who controls it , who says where you have to be at what point , is a key question when deciding whether or not you are actually at work .
as for the dedication of doctors , yes , there is enormous dedication there but i do not feel safe at the hands of a doctor who has been on call for 00 hours and is swaying with tiredness while he is trying to make a decision how to treat me .
that is a personal experience .
we are told that many people want to work longer hours because they really love their jobs – just as we all do .
good .
but we also recognise that there is more to life than paid work .
we are seeing again in certain countries a decline in voluntary work , for example , with all the repercussions that has for wider society .
we are also told that we need additional flexibility so that people can do overtime to earn a living wage .
if this has to be done on a regular basis , i contend that there is a problem with the basic wage paid , rather than the right to continue compulsory overtime .
we all know about the pressures exerted by teams to make sure you turn up for that overtime , whether you want to or not .
a lot of this debate sounds to me at times rather like gender discrimination : people claim it does not exist because they have never experienced it .
part of this is the question whether or not people have a real choice , say in the uk with its opt-out , as to whether or not they work longer hours .
we know of the enormous pressure exerted on people by employers , by methods of working , by just-in-time production , by a whole set of things such as the macho work culture that says you are not dedicated to your job unless you are in at 0 a.m. in the morning and still there at 00 p.m. at night .
i am sure that a number of the staff in this parliament will recognise that feeling .
the issue of flexibility is about who makes that decision .
i would be happier with a lot of the uk 's arguments if i felt there really was a concerted effort by the uk government to apply the rules .
but i do not see any evidence of this and it is not what i am hearing at meeting after meeting either .
mr president , the commission has prepared a draft amendment of a directive relating to the eu labour market .
the purpose of the original directive was , out of health and safety considerations , to safeguard employees against unduly long working days by setting a maximum working time of 00 hours per week .
the directive nonetheless makes it possible for the employee , by means of his signature , to permit this maximum of 00 hours per week to be worked only as an average over a whole year .
employers are accorded flexibility at the expense of employees ’ welfare .
this has , for example , led to millions of britons increasing their working time to more than 00 hours per week since the directive was introduced .
it is a sick way in which to organise labour market legislation .
the directive supports the principle of individual agreements that is contrary to the collective agreement model that exists in denmark .
among danes , there is considerable backing for the national model in which , for example , working time and wage conditions are established through free negotiations between independent trade unions and employer associations .
employees use ballots to agree upon the conditions under which they wish to work .
the directive on working time is an example of the eu ’s needing to keep clear of labour market policy and leave this to the member states .
the proximity principle must be taken seriously .
unfortunately , we are now in a situation in which the eu has already legislated in this area .
the report on revising the directive proposes closing those gaps in it that employers have misused to exploit the unfair individual agreements .
in practice , employers have , upon employing people , in many cases put pressure on them to accept longer working hours .
this individualisation is unacceptable as a basis for labour market agreements .
to conclude , therefore , we are voting in favour of the rapporteur ’s report and against the majority of the many amendments .
mr president , commissioner , rapporteur , we are dealing with a report which i believe to be of profound social , legal and political importance .
the issue is very simple , therefore , on a theoretical level .
the first aspect is the reference periods for the application of article 0 ( maximum weekly working time ) : four months , as laid down in article 00 of the directive , or , where appropriate , the possibility of extension in the cases laid down in article 00 : up to six and twelve months if implemented by means of collective agreements or agreements between social partners .
the second aspect is the power not to apply article 0 if the worker is in agreement , the system of opting-out , as has been said here already .
clearly , a consequence of extending the reference periods would be to increase the flexibility available to companies .
the only limit would be the eleven hours of rest daily or the twenty-four hours of rest weekly , but the directive would be losing its purpose and only regulating the maximum <unk> , six-monthly or annual working time , depending on the particular case .
with regard to opting-out , the potential for abuse is obvious , particularly in a situation of legal equality but not economic equality between the protagonists in working life .
directive 00/000/ec is intended to guarantee a higher level of health and safety protection for workers , as reiterated in directive 0000/00/ec .
we should therefore seek effective solutions to the cases and activities which require them , such as those involved in the judgments mentioned here , simap or <unk> , but with objective criteria and conditions , to be used generally and in a <unk> fashion ; and under no circumstances turning the exception into the general rule .
i therefore believe that before the vote we should seek agreements which combine legal guarantees for workers with creating more flexibility , in the spirit of directive 00/000/ec .
mr president , a number of references were made to us , the british labour meps .
we clearly recognise the importance of this issue for our political group and for working people , particularly the issue of work/life balance and health and safety .
that has been established and eloquently spoken about by a number of speakers .
we do not want to see a <unk> culture ; we want to see higher productivity .
we want to see working people have the kind of work that allows them the leisure they deserve .
we fully support the repeated statements by our government stating that the opt-out should not be abused and that the exercise of the opt-out must be truly voluntary to be legal under uk law .
we need clarification of the simap and jaeger judgments .
as british labour meps , we also believe that it is inappropriate for infringement proceedings to be taken against the uk government .
we have tabled amendment 0 , which deletes the recommendation that the uk government should be subject to infringement proceedings .
however , we believe in the principle of working time and want to see progress , particularly in the health sector .
mr president , the proposals by the european commission on working time obey the demands of the employers for flexible working time .
they increase the level of exploitation of the working class and maximise the profits of big business .
according to these proposals , workers will be at the immediate disposal of employers whenever , when and for as long as the employer wants , without overtime pay , a fact which the european court of justice itself has condemned .
thus they abolish basic rights of the workers , such as a set working day , eight hours or seven hours , five days a week .
collective working agreements are being cast aside and fixed term contracts are being extended .
the right to insurance and normal leave is being violated , while greater flexibility in employment relations is being promoted .
any positive arrangements are <unk> by the planned derogations and the application of the ' opting-out ' clause imposed by the united kingdom and also used by other countries .
in it , the workers are dragged under the pressure of securing a job .
it is a form of modern paid slavery , which forces a large percentage of the workforce to work an average of between 00 and 00 hours a week , with deteriorating health and safety conditions and very serious repercussions on the mental and physical health of workers .
we support the reduction in working time , the introduction of a genuine 00-hour week of seven set working hours a day , five days a week , an increase in wages and full insurance and employment rights which will apply universally to all workers and all enterprises .
we are fighting together with the workers to overturn the current anti-labour framework and flexible forms of employment .
mr president , i would like to stress the importance of the text on which we are going to vote on the revision of the directive on the organisation of working time , which , as mr pronk stressed , commissioner , ought to have taken place by 00 november 0000 .
it is because we have waited for too long that we find ourselves in this situation .
recently , president prodi presented to us a document entitled ‘ delivering lisbon ’ .
we cannot deny that , to make europe the most dynamic economic power in the world , we need to have policies that perform to help businesses adapt to new production conditions and to ever-increasing economic competition whilst taking into account the safety and health of workers .
this is why , in order to adapt to the realities of the market , we need to evolve in a relatively flexible framework .
given this , organisation of working time is dependent on a number of factors and on the characteristics of the sector of activity concerned and of the profession in question .
it is on that basis , for example , that we have already legislated for mobile workers in the transport sector , but we have recognised and accepted the concept of flexibility for people driving goods vehicles over 0.0 tonnes .
we also have a certain number of problems as regards homeworkers and also those working in situations that involve caring for others , because private and professional life are often intermingled in this area .
that is the first point .
the second point is that , in addition to these differences according to sectors , we must draw attention to the specific characteristics of national industrial relations systems .
some member states call on collective or workforce agreements to establish the average working time , whilst others resort to individual derogations which make it possible for workers in , for example , supervisory positions , not to be subjected to restrictions in working time .
i do , of course , agree with the fact that the european union is duty bound to lay down minimum conditions governing the organisation of working time in order to guarantee a high level of health and safety protection for workers .
should it not at the same time , though , give enterprises the option of reacting contrary to general practice when faced with different constraints ?
this is why it seems to me that the rapporteur ’s opinion would have to be qualified by accepting , for example , as you initially proposed , commissioner , the gradual abolition of the opt out , provided for in article 00 of the directive , in return for the introduction , in the future draft revision of the directive , of a derogation at article 0 to allow periods of inactivity partially to be taken into account .
this would probably be a transitional solution that would make it possible to have minimal social rules whilst , at the same time , taking into account the constraints of each sector .
mr president , the basis of the whole working time directive is now in the process of being eroded .
pressure is being exerted from two sides .
this comes firstly in relation to the individual opt-out .
mr bushill-matthews and mrs lynne are very enthusiastic about these individual opt-outs . i think , however , that we are obliged now to ask them why , if individual opt-outs are so fantastic , this provision should not be extended to apply to all legislation concerning health and safety in the workplace .
why stop here ?
why not go further and include noise , asbestos and other areas if it is such a splendid principle ?
there is also a prevailing misunderstanding that it is the individual opt-out that makes it possible to work long hours .
i should like to invite both mr bushill-matthews and mrs lynne to get out and about in europe and visit a few workplaces and to come to denmark where they will see that it is , in actual fact , possible to work very long hours in various industries in denmark and , at the same time , to comply with the directive , for it is very flexible .
nor , at the same time , must we of course forget that we are concerned here with health and safety in the workplace .
it is not just something that the social democrats have <unk> upon in order to be officious and over-zealous or in order to limit individual flexibility .
we also know that the statistics are clear in their implications .
we know that there is a clear connection between long working hours and accidents at work .
moreover , it is generally known that the number of sick days is increasing and that long working hours do not in actual fact mean higher productivity .
nor can we ignore the fact that it is women who will be placed in a difficult position if we simply extend working time , the natural consequence being that a number of women will perhaps withdraw completely from the labour market .
i am certain that the right-hand side of the chamber too will appreciate that this would be very unfortunate for the european economy .
the second pressure on the working time directive stems directly from the fact that the commission has neglected to say what it intends to do as a consequence of the jaeger and simap judgments .
these rigid judgments have sent shock waves through the national and regional health authorities which simply cannot imagine how they are to make ends meet if on-call hours are to be fully charged for .
i would go so far as to say to the commission that , if it does not do something soon and produce a proposal , it will itself contribute to the image of the eu as something removed from the real world and unable to come up with flexible solutions .
we badly need a revision of the directive that abolishes the individual opt-out but that constantly provides for flexibility where there is a need for this , for example in the health sector .
i would also ask the right wing today to take note of the fact that no one is asking for a very rigid directive .
we are all asking for flexibility , but we must not of course destroy the principles behind having legislation in this area .
finally , i should like to ask for the revised directive also clearly to indicate that it can be implemented with the help of collective agreements .
i say this not just to harp on about time-honoured danish practices , but also because this method of implementation puts a stop to the individual ways of doing things and , at the same time , provides for a very high-level implementation of the directive .
that is why this is a sound way of proceeding , and that is why i should like to ask the commission specifically to state in the directive that the directive can be implemented by means of collective agreements .
mr president , the exercise that we are currently carrying out to revise a 0000 directive on the organisation of working time is worthwhile .
it should not , however , have diverged either needlessly or too far from the objective pursued , that is to say the possible amendment of the directive in order to guarantee a better level of health and safety protection for workers .
the opinion of the committee on women ’s rights and equal opportunities is , unfortunately , another typical example of that very process , since it made a brilliant job of missing the point of the report .
i had tabled a series of amendments aimed at removing from the text of this opinion the obvious falsehoods , according to which working hours are apparently being extended all over the place in the european union and long working hours being imposed in our member states , with negative effects on our health , well-being and appetite for life .
the opinion then concludes by heaping criticism on the would-be culture of long working hours for high level professionals and others , managers in particular .
these generalisations and falsehoods do not serve our objective , designed to promote a better level of health and safety protection for workers .
for some here , a massive reduction in working time is the universal remedy for all problems .
i regret that my attempts to qualify the statements of some members and to re-establish the truth did not find favour with the committee on women ’s rights and equal opportunities and , above all , i regret that the rapporteur repeated certain falsehoods , in particular that which would have us believe that working hours continue to be extended in the european union when , in the majority of member states , the opposite is true .
my group has tabled a host of amendments designed to re-establish truth and reason on this sensitive issue and aimed , in particular , at those populists who would have our european citizens believe that they can always work a lot less to earn a lot more than their colleagues in other parts of the world .
mr president , i wish to thank the rapporteur , who has prepared a very constructive report .
sometimes when i listen to the speeches , i get the feeling that health and safety aspects as they relate to the private individual – which , strictly speaking , is what the legislation is really about – are not the main point .
i am , to be honest , frightened when i hear the british representatives of the group of the european people ’s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats and of the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party . they say that , in view of the fact that certain jobs have such low wages , we must allow employees to work longer hours so as to compensate for these low wages .
what is this other than the model that exists in the united states where people sometimes need two or three jobs in order to be at all able to take care of their families ?
is that what we agreed to in the lisbon process ?
certainly , we must have competitiveness and growth , but we must also have challenging social objectives and the opportunity to combine family life and working life .
these principles , about which we have expressed our opinions , are directly contrary to flexibility of that kind .
the problem is that the exception has become the rule in the united kingdom .
it is never the intention that an exception should become the rule , but it has become so in the uk .
if the opt-out is extended , there is a danger of the member states competing by means of longer working time in order to attract production .
is that the kind of europe we want : one in which we compete in terms of social legislation ?
no , i do not want a europe like that .
i think , however , that we must have flexibility , just as mrs thorning-schmidt said .
i do not , however , see the individual opt-out as a possibility .
think how dependent the individual employees are on their companies when they are to agree upon wages and working time .
the word ‘ voluntary ’ does not apply , no matter what people say .
it is much better to involve the two sides of industry .
there are differences between various industries and , sometimes , certain industries may require special arrangements in order to achieve flexibility and , at the same time , maintain the principles of health and safety .
i therefore recommend collective agreements through which this flexibility can be achieved .
i am not in favour of renationalisation , because it would have the same effect .
it would mean countries competing with each other by attracting capital available to them because of their not prioritising health and safety .
we want to use our european model to stimulate competitiveness but , at the same time , have challenging social objectives and the opportunity of combining working life and parenthood .
let us comply with this model , in which case we must remove the individual opt-out , at the same time as preserving flexibility and a high level of safety .
that concludes the debate .
the vote will be at noon on wednesday .
the next item is the report ( a0-0000 / 0000 ) by <unk> flesch , on behalf of the committee on development and cooperation , on the work of the acp-eu joint parliamentary assembly in 0000 ( 0000/0000 ( ini ) ) .
mr president , debates on this report in the committee on development and cooperation took place in a constructive climate , and i would like to thank members for the amendments that they tabled and that it was possible to incorporate into this report , thus improving the motion for a resolution put to you .
the striking fact of 0000 was certainly that the joint parliamentary assembly could return to a normal rhythm of work following the cancellation of the november 0000 session due to circumstances of which you are aware .
on this issue , the result of the mission carried out by the acp co-president and four acp parliamentarians in harare should be particularly welcomed . they managed to persuade the zimbabwean government to agree to the head of its delegation in the assembly no longer being someone who is covered by the council ’s restrictive measures .
the acp co-president ’s personal commitment to ensuring that only the head of the zimbabwean delegation can take the floor during the session in rome should also be welcomed .
aside from this important aspect , six points deserve to be mentioned as regards the work of the assembly in 0000 .
the entry into force of the new rules of procedure allowed the debates to be better structured .
the more informal organisation of question time with the commission , at the sixth session in rome , proved its worth and led to a livelier debate .
it was possible to organise and carry out four joint missions in 0000 .
the women ’s forum was a success both at the 0th session in brazzaville and at the 0th session in rome .
it was possible to significantly improve and deepen cooperation between the joint parliamentary assembly and the united nations .
finally , two important reports were adopted , one on children ’s rights , and those of child soldiers in particular , and the other on the use of the european development fund and the discussions initiated on its budgetisation .
to summarise , mr president , the committee on development and cooperation gives a positive view of 0000 .
the difficulties of the previous year , which culminated in the cancellation of the session of november 0000 , have been overcome thanks to efforts on both sides , in particular from the co-presidents and the bureau of the assembly . the latter was also able to resume a normal rhythm of work .
improvements have been made to the organisation of its work , allowing it to make its voice heard more clearly and to actively participate in the political dialogue provided for in the cotonou agreement .
i hope , mr president , that our assembly will be able to adopt the report by the committee on development and cooperation .
mr president , i should like first of all to express my satisfaction on this very informative report concerning the work of the joint parliamentary assembly , which is very useful not only for us , but also for the interested agencies which somehow create relations between europe and these countries .
as the members of the assembly know and as noted in mrs flesch 's report , my colleague poul nielson is actively involved in the work of this assembly and the commission services are trying in any way they can to support it with documents and information , while the experts in the standing committees are also now preparing the assembly reports .
thus , i think that the commission 's genuine interest is clear , as is its close and efficient cooperation with the joint parliamentary assembly .
i should like to mention three points .
the first is that we absolutely welcome the setting up of these three standing committees following the approval of the new rules of procedure in 0000 .
thanks to preparatory cooperation between these committees , the reports present a high degree of accuracy and the debates in plenary are much clearer , specific and detailed .
secondly , i believe that the setting up of the women 's forum is very important .
this forum has provided the possibility for women 's opinions to be heard and the possibility for mutual support .
thus , there is the possibility for the assembly 's proposals to be enriched with issues which relate to equality of the two sexes and the broader participation of women .
finally , the joint parliamentary assembly is a very important forum for political dialogue between meps and mps from the acp countries and , consequently , it is the commission 's duty to support this entire effort .
i should like to take advantage of the seventh plenary assembly in addis ababa to inform you , even though you already know , that two of our colleagues , <unk> nielson and pascal lamy , will be speaking , and i should like to express my best wishes for a successful assembly .
mr president , the report on the work of the acp-eu joint parliamentary assembly contains some important considerations .
it is good to see that the degree and quality of cooperation between the joint parliamentary assembly and the united nations reached unprecedented levels .
i think its is especially worthwhile that enhanced cooperation with the un is visible in the matter of child soldiers , as is evident from the report .
this is an area where the battle cannot be ended before it is completely won .
even one child soldier is a gross injustice to humanity and its future .
there are an estimated 000 000 child soldiers under the age of 00 involved in some 00 conflicts throughout the world .
using children as soldiers is a violation of their human rights and deprives them of their childhood and the chance for education and building a better future as a result .
being a soldier always causes serious psychological and often also physical damage in children .
the use of child soldiers has increased with , for example , the development of weapons technology , as children can be made to use ever lighter and smaller weapons .
the reason for the increase in the use of child soldiers is also due to the nature of modern warfare : most of today ’s armed conflicts are civil wars .
in the time of the first world war just 00 % of the war ’s casualties were civilians . now the corresponding figure is 00 % .
civil wars are waged between different ethic groups , which in practice means civilian populations .
in this way children become targets and easily recruited additional troops .
children obey orders more readily than adults .
children have had to witness atrocities and carry them out themselves under coercion .
many guerrilla movements even prefer child soldiers to <unk> combatants .
furthermore , children are prepared to take risks that adults would refuse to .
one example is iran , where children were used as messengers in minefields .
the international save the children alliance was heard when the un security council met in mid-january 0000 to discuss the plight of children in armed conflicts .
the debate was preceded by the third report by the un secretary-general on children and armed conflicts .
for the first time in an official report those responsible for using child soldiers were named .
this is a significant step forward because it allows international pressure to be put on those who grossly violate children ’s rights .
this otherwise excellent report is still in need of some small stylistic improvements .
the question time in rome was certainly animated , as points 0 and 00 state and which is all too commendable , but as it is actually mentioned twice , one gets the impression that this is an altogether unusual exception to the rule and that the basic nature of our work is lifeless and anaemic .
mr president , i can assure the last speaker that we are neither lifeless nor anaemic in the work that we undertake in the joint parliamentary assembly .
the references which the excellent rapporteur makes are to the fact that we now have a parliamentary status and a very different way of working but , most important , the acp representation is of elected members of parliament and not of ambassadors , which used to be the case in the past .
i am sure if the previous speaker were to look at the evidence she would see that was the case .
it is because we have this parliamentary status under the cotonou partnership agreement that we have a new and dynamic maturity .
the parliamentary assembly is a very special institution : it is the democratic arm of acp-eu cooperation and provides a voice for the people in the 00 countries which are represented there .
it is our task to build credible and workable partnerships through dialogue and consultation between our respective parliaments .
in our last joint assembly we worked on the epa trade negotiations , human rights , governance , the european development fund and environmental concerns .
our entire effort is to ensure that we deliver the promise and vision of cotonou .
our work should reflect that unique subscription between the eu and 00 acp countries to those values which are enshrined in the agreement .
those values are central to our work here in parliament and to our work with developing countries , and that is democracy , the rule of law and , above all , the eradication of poverty .
we are conscious of the difference of opportunity that exists between our acp colleagues and ourselves .
we have access to staff and technology to assist us with our work , and far greater opportunities to cooperate and work together , as we are now in our preparations for addis ababa at the end of this week .
in addition , we have far more of a tradition of parliamentary scrutiny .
i am delighted that commissioner nielson has on a number of occasions expressed his support for the joint assembly and for financial resources to be made available for us to be more effective in our work and for the participation of acp parliaments to be greater , because , after all , it is their legitimacy and accountability as parliamentarians that is at the heart of our work .
i am encouraged by the growing confidence of acp parliamentarians , and that has been demonstrated , as mrs flesch says , by the extensive participation now from both sides in the debates we are having .
we comment on it because it is growing and developing as confidence increases .
in the past it was the european parliamentarians who dominated every debate and that , i am glad to say , is no longer the case .
they are absolutely hungry for information in order that they can be more effective in their parliaments .
i know that some countries – such as senegal – are making a priority of parliamentary training and capacity-building in their national indicative programmes .
but we need to do more to encourage more jpa parliaments to have this facility .
we are now preparing for the seventh session of the jpa in addis ababa this weekend and i am sure that we will continue to work in an increasingly impressive and focused way in 0000 .
– mrs flesch , i should like to congratulate you mainly on the tone of the positive , yet critical , remarks in your explanation .
i am finding it a little harder to come to terms with certain euphoric elements that i will highlight in the text itself .
as mrs kinnock pointed out at great length , the new rules of procedure of the <unk> joint parliamentary assembly have created structures allowing for a real , fruitful dialogue .
it appears to me a little premature to herald it as a world model at this stage .
there is no doubt that in future , it can become a world model in the field of development cooperation and a place in which people with equal rights can have an open and transparent dialogue , about democracy and the protection of human rights , thus enabling us to enter into binding agreements with each other .
we are not that far yet .
there are structures in place and both sides must now make effective use of them .
this will require an increase in resources on the acp side and quite possibly , a change in mentality on both , because the eu partner will also change following the accession of ten new countries .
i wonder whether the sound results which we have already achieved in the joint working party , and which are reflected , among others , in the report on child soldiers , can be repeated shortly in our general assembly , where the tone of discussion has picked up a great deal , even though i still sometimes miss the acp 's equal participation .
our forum should develop into an effective north-south parliament with a real impact on the orientation of our attitudes , for example with regard to world trade .
not only do we want trade , we also want trade .
i think that we will have to determine our policy in tandem with the acp beforehand and that we should not always agree among the rich before we head to a conference in cancun or wherever .
the un 's millennium declaration lists major issues in which we would like to make real improvement , for example by halving global poverty and with regard to good governance , health , education and an end to the oppression of women , these should all be items on the agenda , the progress of which we can measure in the framework of the acp-eu meetings .
we must become real partners in the development of north and south , and i should like to emphasise that consultation is necessary at all times if we are to be spared the disastrous effects of such incidents as those in zimbabwe .
mr president , the cooperation system that links the european union to the acp countries is marked by a dual evolution in opposite directions .
on the one hand , the original institutions implemented by the lomé conventions and confirmed by the cotonou convention , notably the joint parliamentary assembly , have manifestly endured and are livelier than ever , and the report by mrs flesch clearly shows the innovative developments in the joint assembly in 0000 .
at the same time , however , the objectives and the substance of the cooperation , which these institutions are there to implement , are tending to weaken , degenerate , be trivialised , break apart and dissolve , to the point where , soon – if we let this carry on – they will consist only of financial aid with an upper limit and of standard free trade agreements that could be more a source of difficulty for the acp countries than real instruments to aid their development .
as the rapporteur stresses , the creation in 0000 of three standing committees , in particular a committee on economic development , finance and trade responsible for looking at the extremely delicate issue of negotiating future partnership agreements , reinforces the continuity of the parliamentary assembly and allows the quality of its work to be improved .
the system of co-rapporteurs is original , and the work of the committee will lead to stronger , more finely tuned , better prepared and less routine resolutions , which will lead to much more in-depth debates than was possible in the plenary .
if , however , the institutional framework is enhanced and fine-tuned , we need to ask ourselves about the future of the cooperation instruments themselves .
if future economic partnership agreements merely apply the principle of equality of competitors , is there not a risk that they will create insurmountable accounting problems for acp countries by making them lose out on a large part of their customs revenue , which is an important , and sometimes an essential , part of their budget ?
moreover , is there not a risk that putting community merchandise and local products in direct competition with each other without sufficient safeguards will weaken or even suffocate a number of sectors of activity in the acp countries ?
if we want to do our bit to avoid these wayward developments , then this unique north-south parliamentary forum that is the joint assembly , must ensure that major negotiation of partnership agreements is carried out with the necessary ambition and energy , in particular in the area of agriculture , which is the platform for development .
the acp countries will , however , only have a sufficiently strong agriculture if it is adequately protected as a budding industry as it gets off the ground .
the cotonou framework , that of regional economic zones , can be seen as the most appropriate framework to promote the establishment of homogeneous regional common markets with a common external tariff .
it is by working in this direction , mr president , that acp and european countries will no longer find themselves on different playing fields in future negotiations regarding agriculture and world trade .
mr president , allow me firstly to say that the report is constructive and provides a correct description of the work in the acp-eu joint parliamentary assembly .
the work has acquired a better structure with the three committees , something that has improved the preparatory work prior to the plenary .
question time has also improved .
it may of course be further improved if the answers to the questions reach meps in good time , so that the commission does not merely read out the answers but provides scope for debate .
i personally should like to emphasise the constructive cooperation between the acp-eu assembly and the un when it comes both to child soldiers and children ’s vulnerability in war and to the debate concerning the international criminal court .
these are two major and important political issues of precisely the kind that our assembly should engage with , for they are about finding sound forms of cooperation in which both sides learn from each other and support the policy we consider to be important in the international arena .
the united states has removed its financial support from those countries that do not back the us ’s demands that all americans in general must be exempted from being brought before the international criminal court for serious war crimes .
this measure can and must be supported both politically and financially by the acp-eu , especially by the eu .
it is gratifying to note that , of the latin american and west indian countries , it is only belize that has given in to the us ’s action and , of the african countries , only nigeria , whose president ratified an agreement with the united states that was contrary to the nigerian constitution and in defiance of the nigerian parliament .
it is gratifying that most other countries have resisted the pressure from the united states .
the acp-eu assembly plays an important political and economic role in major , crucial issues in the international arena .
that concludes the debate .
the vote will be tomorrow at 00.00 a.m. .
the next item is the report ( a0-0000 / 0000 ) by hans modrow , on behalf of the committee on development and cooperation , on the communication from the commission to the council and the european parliament on the reform of state-owned enterprises in developing countries with focus on public utilities : the need to assess all the options ( com ( 0000 ) 000 – 0000/0000 ( ini ) )
and
the communication from the commission to the council and the european parliament on european community cooperation with third countries : the commission ’s approach to future support for the development of the business sector ( com ( 0000 ) 000 – 0000/0000 ( ini ) .
. – mr president , this report is based on two commission communications , both of which are evidence of the efforts the commission is making to take action in the areas to which they refer , whilst not drawing a veil over the highly contradictory way in which the process is moving now that it is underway .
it follows that the underlying principle – of cautious and balanced actions – is the right one .
the commission has various options in mind for the reform process , and the report makes reference to them .
for the rapporteur , the most important thing is still that every orientation and every reform measure must be aimed at combating poverty , consistently and without ideological blinkers .
containing poverty , and eventually overcoming it , will be the greatest challenge facing the human race in the twenty-first century .
the progress made so far is , however , modest at best , and new setbacks are constantly hindering or even nullifying it .
it is for that reason that the report , like the commission communication , discusses a wide variety of options , although there is no mistaking the different emphases and priorities adopted by the commission and the rapporteur .
although services of general interest are the subject of controversy in the member states of the european union , they may , in those countries , be regarded as relatively stable , but problems are nevertheless ever-present .
that is far more the case in the developing countries and will remain so for longer , for they often totter on the brink of a catastrophe .
the european union ’s efforts should , above all , be devoted to supporting and motivating them .
whilst the commission , and also several of my fellow-members of this house , are strongly in favour of privatisation , all the experience we have had , including in the eu ’s member states , leads me to urge that , along with a responsible role for the public sector and the state , the focus should be on cooperative solutions and also the involvement of the private sector in these states .
in the private business sector , priority should be given to the promotion and development of small - and medium-sized enterprises , which lay the foundation for more jobs and self-supporting economic development in developing countries .
i cannot , in principle , endorse mr deva ’s amendments .
were they to be adopted , the report would lose its critical view of things and would not be equal to the nuanced handling of the reform process that is necessary .
nor , too , are they in line with the primary tendency of the report as adopted by the committee .
finally , they do not go as far as the commission in terms of willingness to enter into dialogue , and are incompatible with the character of the reform process .
as rapporteur , i have endeavoured to propose and achieve workable solutions .
far from sticking rigidly to principles and to ideological points of view , everything should be subordinated to the great goal of the war on poverty .
mr president , the commission welcomes the report by mr modrow and the support which it gives to the application of the two communications .
it is clear that the commission , with these two communications , is trying to highlight the importance of the business sector to development .
the development of businesses and the existence of a dynamic private sector are basic factors in economic development and are the main source of employment in developing countries , especially if account is taken of the unofficial sector of the economy .
we outlined the experience which the commission has as regards the support of the private sector , the benefits which derive from action at community level and the need to harmonise the various means .
thus , we can determine sectors which reflect the actions undertaken by the commission , on the one hand , and those which are rightly left to others to implement , on the other .
as far as state-owned enterprises are concerned , our intention is to contribute to their reform in developing countries .
it is clear that there are huge losses and inefficiency in state-owned enterprises but , of course , this reform needs to be integrated into the framework of plans to restore macro-economic and financial balances and promote development .
we avoided adopting easy or simplified ideological approaches .
finally , we have not put an end to the discussion on ownership , by which i mean if they are state-owned or private enterprises or partnerships between the public and private sectors .
our objective is to expose all the arguments and analyse them so that , once we have objectively got all the interpretations , we can make a final choice which reflects the needs of each country and each sector .
i would remind you that the commission has always had a constant position on these programmes , which always took account of the social repercussions of programmes to liberate the economy and it is interesting that , over the years , even the bretton woods institutions have adopted the same stand .
we recognise the huge importance of domestic investors , as well as the investments which european small - and medium-sized enterprises can make , especially those which have experience and knowledge .
we highlight the need to lay down suitable regulatory frameworks and supervisory mechanisms ; these are issues of vital importance on which the commission wishes to put its experience and the high level of expertise which it has at the disposal of the developing countries .
as i mentioned , we place great emphasis on the need to attract investors and create a favourable environment .
this strategy has as its objective the development of the credit sector in developing countries , the promotion , as an efficient means of funding , of small enterprises and micro-credit institutions which play a vital role in granting small loans to the unofficial sector of the economy , which mainly includes enterprises run by women .
the two communications are complementary and have been drafted on the criterion and with the ultimate objective of further reducing poverty .
i hope that , with the debate in parliament and your resolution on it , we shall make a better contribution to the understanding of the need to invigorate business development in these countries and help the necessary reform of state-owned enterprises .
. mr president , i congratulate the rapporteur , mr modrow , for taking the initiative to produce a report on this important subject .
i am pleased to be associated with the report as draftsman of the opinion of the committee on industry external trade , research and energy .
i am particularly pleased that the committee on development and cooperation decided to integrate fully the recommendations which i made on behalf of the industry committee .
i would like to highlight what i believe are some of the key elements in the reform of state-owned and private enterprises in developing countries .
later in the week , corporate governance is on the agenda in this house , following the recent parmalat case in italy .
we are all aware also of the enron scandal in the united states .
in other words , the issues of the efficient running of enterprises are as pertinent in western , developed market economies as they are in developing countries .
nevertheless , it must be acknowledged that a thriving and efficient private sector can play a major role in developing the economy of third countries and in combating poverty .
i fully support the idea of eu assistance to the business sector in developing countries through intermediaries .
i share the commission 's view that reforms of state-owned enterprises must take account of the capacity and resources of the countries involved .
many of the enterprises in question are essential to development in the fields of energy , water , transport and infrastructure .
reform of state-owned enterprises in developing countries should not be confined to privatisation measures .
an overriding goal should be to ensure affordable access to services of general interest , such as water supply , drainage , energy supply , education and health services .
the eu should encourage reform strategies which involve domestic investors and devote particular attention to decentralised solutions involving small and medium-sized enterprises .
in conclusion , i believe that businesses in developing countries should be assisted , particularly in the fields of good governance , institution building and consultancy .
our own sme sector should be actively engaged in this process .
mr president , i applaud the development of the rapporteur 's ideas in recent years on this subject .
i enjoyed working with him in the committee on development and cooperation on this report .
there is no single holistic approach to the management of public utilities that fits all developing countries .
evidence from <unk> developing countries in the past 00 years shows that state-owned enterprises have , in the majority of cases , failed to efficiently and cost-effectively provide water , waste management , municipal services , road transport , aviation services , mining , reforestation and energy supplies , thereby making them a considerable burden on the state budget , hindering economic growth and impoverishing the poorest .
poverty , diseases and lost economic opportunities have increased because of the state management of public utilities by bureaucrats whose first priority is job security and not economic efficiency : just look at the failed soviet system .
it is imperative to get the private sector involved in the provision of public services in developing countries in order to increase cost efficiency as well as economic growth .
the private sector alone can generate sustainable employment and is the driving force of every modern economy .
public utilities in developing countries should be privatised through open international procedures that are transparent , quick and not onerous , and able to meet sustainable development and public interest criteria .
ideally , the award of a tender should be the sole task of an independent , foreign financial institution , acting alone , according to international norms and reporting conditions , and one that has no conflict of interest in that country or in that project .
i have studied this process for many years and have sadly come to a very sad and bitter conclusion : many foreign direct investors are put off by tedious and laborious tender procedures , consultants ' reports , evaluation committees and committees to evaluate other evaluations – devices constructed by officials of developing countries and consultants to international bodies to earn money either through fees or corruption .
these procedures are an open door to the impoverishment of countries through delay , vacillation and corruption .
the more decision-makers there are in the loop , the more corruption there is .
such corruption takes various forms .
the first form is that of accelerating a decision and overlooking a better bid by making payments to high government officials , such as are to be found in east asian countries .
the other form of less detectable corruption to be found in south asian countries and africa is making payments to block the success of another more favourable bid by a competitor .
in the former case , despite the corruption and the more inferior services now provided , the job gets done and some form of utility is provided , while in the latter nothing ever gets done and the economy suffers .
the former is endemic in the north and east asian countries , while the latter is epidemic in south asia and africa .
when large transnational companies are encouraged to invest , through foreign direct investment , in developing countries , they should also be empowered to make offset investments .
by offset investments i mean that they should be able to put a part of that investment into social capacity-building , into schools , hospitals , training colleges and youth centres , so that there is a public element in the privatisation of a public utility whereby everybody around the utility benefits .
this is the way forward , with transparency and openness .
mr president , i want to refer to the part of the report which concerns the reform of state-owned enterprises .
i welcome the commission 's communication and i agree with the commissioner that we need reform of state-owned enterprises .
when resources are tight , we need to ensure that they are used effectively .
i also agree that we have to be sensitive to the needs of the countries involved and not adopt dogmatic solutions .
if you look at our own history , public services have played a vital role in our economic development : they helped to end poverty and disease , and , by adopting the principle of universal access to public services , we managed to help eradicate poverty , raise living standards and create more equal societies .
when we are looking at public services in the developing world , we must also focus on the eradication of poverty as a top priority of our reform of public services and state enterprises .
there is one other key ingredient we should not miss out on and that is the principle of public accountability .
that accountability should include scrutiny by elected representatives , independent regulation and the involvement of civil society and ngos .
we have some models of good practice in our own countries to show how public services can be held accountable .
if we have more accountability built into the way we look at reform in these countries , i am sure we will have the kind of public services which deliver for people , make sure resources are used effectively and help us to pursue our own development goals of eradicating poverty and raising living standards .
mr president , i will first of all give my enthusiastic support to the report by my colleague mr modrow , in which , to their credit , the two commission communications open up the debate on the position , role and responsibilities of state-owned and private enterprises in developing countries .
according to mr modrow , the report has the virtue of pointing out the contradictions , and sometimes even the inconsistencies , in the european policy .
the union is not actually impartial on the issue of strengthening or not strengthening state-owned sectors in countries with which it has close relations .
unfortunately , it too often advocates a policy of reducing public costs and deficits in response to the structural adjustment measures dear to international financial institutions , a policy which , in its wording , admittedly seeks to reduce poverty but which in reality can end up being to the total detriment of the peoples concerned .
in this way , the incentives and pressures exerted on these countries with a view to privatising their economies has a price , and this is a high price to be paid by the men and women in these countries , a high price for the employees concerned , there as here .
there is a chronic lack of connection between economic and financial objectives , and the need to satisfy , above all else , the needs and fundamental rights of these peoples .
in this framework , the often too exclusive call on the private sector is at best a deception and at worst a seizure of economic , social and political power , which slips from the control of the peoples in these countries .
we are aware of the drastic social consequences of this .
if this is not the case , why then does the commission always refuse to carry out a transparent , public and openly debated assessment of the effect of liberalisation on employment , on the quality and the extent of the services provided and on working conditions in europe itself ?
yet , such an assessment would render more credible its call for the european union ’s experience on this matter to be considered .
if combining a strong and modern state-owned sector and private enterprises could be desirable to meet needs , in particular in the services area , it is nonetheless a fact that the call for public-private partnerships at present actually does more to weaken public enterprises than to create an overall dynamic .
faced with the jungle of competition , the safeguards – when there are any – that are meant to maintain , strengthen and modernise services of state-owned enterprises are not enough .
the ever more dominant role of these transnational companies in the world clearly benefits the financial , speculative and stock market system more than the people of the south .
i am , furthermore , surprised that the commission is furthering privatisation as a means to fight corruption .
in this regard , a great deal of experience in europe and throughout the world far from verifies these assertions .
the eu should strengthen its aid to the developing countries according to the criteria of whether enterprises are modernising by moving towards democratisation in decision-making processes , with more transparency in the operation of public service enterprises .
finally , and i will conclude on this point , the fundamental rights of every person to health and education must remain in the public sphere , just as water , transport , health and energy should remain outside of the gats .
– mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the modrow report is right to highlight a number of painful areas in the privatisation mania that has swept many developing countries .
the nationalisation episode in the decolonisation era was followed by an episode of wild privatisations of undertakings , only for these often to become impoverished .
invariably , it was the political elite that pocketed the profits and placed these in foreign bank accounts during both eras .
invariably , too , western multinationals acted as corrupted undertakings in order to lay their hands , for a song , on vital national industries such as mining and raw materials .
when i visit africa , i am often embarrassed on their behalf about their unethical behaviour , by the way , for example , in which the zambian copper sector , with the closure of the mines , has dragged along with it an entire social fabric , an economic fabric which has shattered an entire country .
i realise that the development of a country requires investments .
however , can the european union not play a more positive role so as to help create the conditions to ensure that the reforms in state-owned undertakings can progress in a more favourable sense for the sake of development ?
i am not calling for dogmatism but for true partnership .
a poor country is often not equal to the financial power of a multinational whose budget is many times greater than that of that country itself .
if even we are not able to enforce the ethical codes of conduct for undertakings , how can we expect those poor countries to do so ?
i join the rapporteur in calling for more attention and more resources to make the transition of small undertakings in the informal sector to the formal economy possible , and also for more resources for women , who are often active in this informal sector .
they must have the first claim on aid , because their undertakings are probably the most direct way in which the fight against poverty in their country can be tackled .
– mr president , support for the development of industry in developing countries is intended to improve those countries ' trading position .
consequently , the commission 's striving towards a predictable legal framework and a decrease in corruption receives my wholehearted support .
with regard to the reform of state-owned undertakings , the commission and the modrow report are less convincing .
first of all , the scope of both the commission 's policy framework and range of duties becomes too unwieldy .
the commission states that all other options must be examined before a developing country chooses to reform a state-owned undertaking .
however , the commission itself admits that the considerations to decide in favour of reform are political decisions .
it is therefore unrealistic to make an objective consideration of the various options a requirement .
secondly , there is social policy .
according to the commission 's communication and the rapporteur , the requirement of social measures must run parallel to reforms .
this sounds charitable , but is inappropriate .
after all , the european community has no powers in the field of employment policy and social policy in the developing countries .
these fall outside the remit of technical support and european development cooperation .
thirdly , in relation to the member states ' policies ; there is hardly any reference in either the commission communication or the modrow report to the member states ' development cooperation in this field .
the sustainable development relation between a developing country and a member state could be the perfect framework in order to , for example , offer support in the event of redundancies .
finally , the relation between state-owned undertakings and poverty reduction ; the commission wishes to use poverty reduction as an assessment criterion for granting support to state-owned undertakings .
this is not in keeping with its neutral position on private versus state ownership .
the criterion should either apply just as much to private undertakings , or should not apply at all .
in conclusion , support to undertakings in developing countries has my blessing , but the line of approach in the case of state-owned undertakings raises essential questions .
– mr president , this report is , in my view , a modest sign of a favourable development .
one of the major problems in the developing world was – and still is to a great extent – the absence of a truly free market economy .
in practice , <unk> and <unk> experiments have generally exacerbated the problems rather than offered a solution to poverty .
there appears to be a gradually growing consensus that governments alone will not bring universal happiness , and we have allowed free initiative to play a role .
this is a positive development , and one that can only be applauded .
as the report states , there are different ways of reforming state-owned undertakings .
nobody can be opposed to gradual change .
we should only add a word of caution with regard to obstacles as a result of all kinds of intermediate levels of government intervention which people might try to incorporate .
it is , at any rate , positive that there is a willingness to provide small - and medium-size companies a role , both and in the european union .
in my view , it is of the utmost importance for there to be a thorough and timely evaluation of the course of affairs , with no taboos , such as corruption , excessive bureaucracy , administrative inefficiency or even sheer incompetence .
moreover , this should not only apply to local governments , but also to ngos and similar organisations , because , where dysfunction is concerned , these are only rarely called to task .
mr president , i wish to welcome the communication from the commission on the reform of state-owned enterprises in developing countries . i wish , however , at the same time to regret the generally negative attitude to free enterprise and private ownership that emerges in the draft report .
the high living standards and prosperity achieved by the western world , japan and australia are not the results of monopoly and protectionism but of the free market economy ’s and private enterprise ’s many dynamic forces that promote development and prosperity .
in europe , this state of affairs has been particularly clear .
half our continent has tried another method involving centralised control and large state monopolies .
the inefficiency and collapse of monopoly socialism in europe has been the experience of many european peoples and has provided them with a bitter lesson .
it is a lesson that we ought , indeed have an obligation to , pass on to countries that wish to construct democratic welfare societies .
the developing countries must be given the same opportunity to develop and create an economic model involving free competition and an open market economy .
it is not the eu ’s task to try to prevent a development towards competition that will bring prosperity in its wake .
it is not too much in the way of a market economy that has been the big problem in the developing countries . on the contrary , the problem has been too little in the way of free economies and too much in the way of monopolies , something that has led to mismanagement , corruption and stagnation .
i fully share the view concerning people ’s need for clean water , efficient drainage , elementary health care and medical treatment , basic education and access to energy .
it is not , however , the form of ownership in itself that is the most important thing , but a high degree of flexibility and efficiency in delivering these services .
competition is very important in this area .
the developing countries naturally need regulations that provide a legal framework , and perhaps this is an area in which the eu can be of great help to the developing countries .
current political solutions in many developing countries are , unfortunately , often ineffective and expensive and only reach a limited proportion of the population .
those developing countries that have succeeded in taking the step from poverty to wealth and prosperity have all given priority to competition and efficiency , not centralised state control and the building of monopolies .
mr president , commissioner diamantopoulou , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank mr modrow for the pertinence of his report since the idea is clearly to subordinate everything to the fight against poverty .
it must be said , however , that one of the two commission communications – the one entitled ‘ reform of state-owned enterprises in developing countries with focus on public utilities : the need to assess all the options ’ – made for more than thought-provoking , but at the same time welcome , reading for me .
indeed , we read that numerous liberalisations and privatisations that were carried out quickly in developing countries , under the pressure of structural adjustment plans that are often imposed , have had disastrous consequences in terms of job losses and the deterioration , and increase in price , of the services concerned .
we would like the commission to show similar clarity and objectivity when dealing with services of general interest within the european union itself .
as is called for in the draft report , an initial step in this direction would be for the commission to finally agree to carry out a transparent , public and openly debated assessment of the effect of liberalisation on employment , on the quality and the extent of the services provided and on working conditions in europe .
this would be just as beneficial internally as it would be in terms of better understanding the state of affairs in the southern countries .
as i say , our objective is clearly to combat poverty and ensure that this is not just all talk .
when we look more closely at the various examples quoted in the communication , we can see that among the positive experiences are cases in which state-owned enterprises have remained state-owned but in which mismanagement and corruption have been combated , the enterprise has gained renewed dynamism and effectiveness in its management and , above all , a regulatory and political framework has been implemented , which has clear objectives that are ambitious in terms of development , accessibility and quality of service and that are , in particular , financed by tariff adjustment .
these different elements do not amount to a commercialisation of the state-owned enterprise according to the commission ’s definition but , instead , constitute , in my view , factors for good management of public utilities , which we also need to establish at european level , perhaps through a framework directive .
a final point is that those in favour of the general liberalisation of utilities though the gats claim that opening up public utilities in developing countries can only benefit them .
a more pragmatic analysis should favour a different economic development strategy : one that is centred on the local economic and social actors and small - and micro-enterprises – with account being taken , in particular , of women and basic public utilities – and one that , above all , does not hand such enterprises over to the reckless appetites of the multinationals .
excuse me at this point , however , for i think we are talking about ethics .
it is therefore clear that the most valuable contribution that the european institutions can make – and i would say , in general , the most important contribution that developed countries can make – is to guarantee legal infrastructure that protects legal certainty and to support and guide processes towards democratisation and the recognition of the principles of the rule of law .
the commission document only briefly refers to this issue , which i consider to be key , and the report by the committee on development and cooperation does , i am sorry to say , drop this reference and concentrates on the tragic consequences of the policies promoted by the international monetary fund and the world bank .
you see , i do not believe that it is right , even in such situations , to attribute liability to the international monetary fund and the world bank for certain bankruptcies ; i am thinking about the argentinian affair , where it is ever clearer that the failure , the decline of the state itself , is not to be attributed to the monetary fund or the world bank but to the level of corruption and the level of statism present in that economy .
it is said that we do not want to be ideological , but i fear that that is what we are in actual fact being .
it is good to consider all the options ; i believe , however , that the political option that we must propose is privatisation of enterprises with a view to seeking efficiency and investment .
we want services to be available to the people , and to be available to an extent , and with a degree of quality , that satisfies needs that are not satisfied today .
i believe that asking corrupt and inefficient public utilities to provide this service is wrong .
the privatisation option – both in europe and also in developing countries – is the politically desirable option .
mr president , in addition to analysing the eu ’s policy to date , these communications are intended to lay the basis for the commission ’s strategies to promote enterprise in developing countries and to prepare the commission ’s position on the reform of state-owned enterprises .
i agree with the rapporteur that the main focus must be on combating poverty and safeguarding the availability of basic services , and that the priority is support for small and medium-sized enterprises .
in recent decades structural adjustment programmes have been used to try and respond to the call for economic development . these have involved the opening up of markets and various types of arrangements , including privatisation .
this , however , has not always improved the situation ; on the contrary , it has contributed substantially to the spread of poverty in developing countries .
the commission quite rightly states that that there are various options for reforming state-owned enterprises , such as reform of a public enterprise without altering its ownership structure , or partial privatisation .
it is absolutely vital to take account of the parameters when selecting different types of reform .
with privatisation , particular attention needs to be devoted to competition law and its implementation .
the various options for reform must be weighed up , and here it is essential to involve civil society , particularly users ’ and consumers ’ organisations , cooperatives and trade unions , in decision-making and in monitoring the measures taken .
at all events , the stated overriding objective of the eu ’s development cooperation – combating poverty – must be taken into account .
the commission communication on the approach to future support for the development of the business sector in third <unk> contains some good basic ideas .
it is excellent that the commission should put forward an overall strategy for the business sector .
the basic aim of that strategy must simply be that there should be investment in the developing countries .
people must be able to expect it .
it cannot be based on the bottomless well principle .
it is important to have tangible support for smes and cooperatives by means of advice in the fields of services , training , business modernisation , and promotion of micro-enterprises , particularly by ensuring there is available funding .
it is nevertheless essential to remember that enterprises and cooperatives in the developing countries also need customers that are going to spend their money , and the market with the greatest purchasing power is us , the eu .
for that reason , the channels of fair and sustainable trade must be made to work in such a way that european consumers are able to support enterprises and producers in developing countries by means of their own purchasing decisions .
that concludes the debate .
the vote will be tomorrow at 00.00 a.m.

the next item is the commission statement on asian bird flu .
. mr president , avian influenza has affected poultry populations in nine countries in asia so far , namely cambodia , the people 's republic of china , including the special administrative region of hong kong , indonesia , japan , laos , pakistan , south korea , thailand and vietnam .
according to an <unk> expert panel held on 0 and 0 february in rome , the current epidemic is still evolving and not yet under control .
as of today , the disease has taken 00 human lives in vietnam and thailand , but a new virus , fully transmissible to humans and capable of spreading from human to human , has not yet emerged .
in total asia has around 00 % of the world 's poultry population and accounts for 00 % of world trade in poultry .
there are 0000 million birds in the affected areas .
already the situation is affecting the world 's grain and meat markets .
this is a devastating disease in poultry causing very high mortality – up to 00 % in 00 hours .
many millions of birds have already died of the disease , or have been destroyed in the fight to halt its spread .
in its sanitary and its economic dimension , not forgetting the animal welfare aspects , this outbreak of avian influenza is unprecedented and , although there is at present no indication of a developing human pandemic , this risk cannot be excluded according to the who .
the disease impact is likely to be most felt by smallholders and owners of backyard flocks which form their main food supply .
it may be more difficult to prevent the disease in these flocks than in larger commercial units .
this has the potential to accelerate trends towards the industrialisation of poultry operations in the affected countries and therefore could have some negative social and environmental consequences .
clearly , the situation affects the european community at many levels and the commission , as well as the member states , has taken decisive action .
the commission has immediately taken safeguard measures to ensure adequate protection against possible disease introduction in the territory of the community via imports of live birds and poultry products from the countries concerned to protect both animal and public health .
the commission has made appropriate arrangements to send an animal health and two public health experts to vietnam to assist in combating the disease in collaboration with the who .
in addition , member states have also sent experts to various other countries .
we have been , and we will continue , monitoring the situation carefully via our delegations , the who , fao , oie , as well as governmental and other non-governmental information sources .
the member states have contingency plans in place according to community legislation , approved by the commission to be implemented in case of avian influenza outbreaks in poultry .
the commission services are at present scrutinising the plans submitted by acceding countries so that they can become operational on the date of accession .
in the public health domain , assessment of risk to humans is carried out on a continuous basis in cooperation with the who and experts from the member states .
rapid exchange of information and mutual consultation on guidelines and measures taken or planned by the member states is ensured via the early-warning and response system of the european community .
further measures and guidelines and consultation procedures could be taken by the commission should the need arise .
moreover , the commission intends to publish a working paper on pandemic influenza preparedness and response planning , which sets out a series of steps to be taken by member states and the european community to address the threat of an avian influenza pandemic .
the commission is collaborating closely with the affected countries to identify areas where help is needed and where it can provide the greatest benefit .
not only the directorate for health and consumer protection , but also those for development , europeaid and our humanitarian aid office , are actively collaborating with local governments and non-governmental organisations .
the ec delegations in the region are actively involved in this process and are coordinating with member state embassies .
right now the commission is preparing a major community contribution to support vietnam 's efforts against avian influenza by the financing of up to eur 0 million worth of protective and laboratory equipment under two ongoing ec assistance programmes under the auspices of dg europeaid .
this will be the largest contribution to date by any donor to vietnam .
an agreement is due to be signed with the who , which should be finalised by the middle of this week .
as time is an important factor , the commission services at all levels are in continuous dialogue with the world health organisation , the fao and world organisation for animal health , and local authorities to share our experience and expertise in disease control as rapidly and with as little red tape as possible .
i would like to take this opportunity to congratulate our staff for this extra effort .
the commission hopes that all these measures and activities will be successful in containing and ultimately eradicating the disease and that we can restore normal practices in our trade and other dealings with the countries affected sooner rather than later .
the commission will continue to follow the issue closely and support affected countries in collaboration and coordination with the relevant international organisations and the member states , and it will adjust community measures in proportion to the risks posed by the disease situation .
mr president , i would like to thank the commissioner for his remarks and i think we can all join him in hoping that what he has outlined will be successful .
i would like to make three points .
first , in relation to the european union 's own services , one imagines that those operating on our behalf in south-east asia are mainly from the food and veterinary office in dublin : our team of european union health and food inspectors .
could the commissioner tell the house how many people are involved in this work ?
he briefly mentioned that .
one of the things that worries the meps who have visited the food and veterinary office is that it is very understaffed .
in fact , i believe there are only 00 inspectors for the entire world .
what worries me is that , if this pandemic in asia is tying up a lot of the efforts of such inspectors , where is the work not being done ?
one of the things we were talking about in the committee recently was the importation of chicken meat from brazil because of the danger that this was impregnated with nitrofurans .
now if we are looking at south-east asia , can the commissioner reassure me that somebody is still looking at what is happening in brazil ?
my second point is about the human health dimension , because although this obviously has an animal health issue at its starting point , the human health dimension is very important .
is mr byrne satisfied that the european union already has the capacity to monitor effectively any signs that an animal epidemic , or a major human pandemic , has started to occur here , given the likelihood of concealment ?
we have come across the element of concealment already in the countries where this has arisen .
there is a temptation , i am sure , for concealment to happen elsewhere in the world also .
will he give some thought to setting up a rapid response team dedicated to planning for the worst in the european union ?
he has outlined something of this , but not perhaps talked about that precise team .
the next report we are debating is very relevant – mr bowis ' report on the european centre for disease prevention and control .
unfortunately , that centre has not yet been set up .
would it be possible for an advance guard of the new centre for disease prevention and control to set up a planning team with which the european parliament can have a dialogue ?
thirdly , mr byrne is also responsible for food safety at home and for legislation regarding food labelling .
given that we do not know exactly what the route of transmission is – if there is a route to humans – and that consumers are wary of food of unknown origin at such a time , would the commission consider providing consumers with extra information via the labelling of the country of origin of the poultry meat component of composite foods which account for a very large section of the european union market ?
i note that mr byrne said that the commission had banned the import of poultry meat and poultry products .
oh really ?
many consumers will tell you that it is impossible to tell where the poultry meat comes from in the composite foods we buy throughout the european union .
this is some of the information which i believe in this context should be given to the consumer .
– mr president , ladies and gentlemen , commissioner byrne , i am sure that the commission has done its best ; i leave it to you to decide whether that , in a report , is always what we want to read .
i also wonder whether what we do is always enough , and whether we really are thinking in terms of what is called preventative consumer protection .
in saying this , commissioner byrne , it is not you alone that i have in mind , but all of us , as well as the governments and your fellow-commissioners .
i will come to that in a moment .
as soon as we heard the first reports of avian influenza , we immediately stopped imports from thailand into the european union .
not much imagination would have been needed to announce on the same day that the whole of asia would be sealed off , which would have been sensible .
it is , perhaps , not very smart to use the domino approach by starting with thailand and then moving on to vietnam and then china .
it would have made sense in view of what we know about how business is done in these countries and how birds and other animals , are traded and sold within them .
what bothers me is the permanent state of - action .
we are always - acting .
along comes avian influenza , we react to it , and then , for whatever reason , nothing happens for a long time .
we discover that poultry meat contains dioxin – and we react .
we discover the presence of prohibited , toxic , and carcinogenic pharmaceuticals in shrimps and other products – and we react .
we react , though , always and only on the spur of the moment , and promptly forget all about it .
that is so naive , so <unk> naive , for we know that the conditions under which animals are kept in the countries under discussion , and the standards of hygiene in asian countries , but in brazil as well , are dire in comparison with our own .
as this is something we keep asking about in this house , i really would like to know what happens when the commissioners discuss this around their table .
when we ask commissioner lamy to give priority , in discussions on the world trade organisation , to consumer protection and hygiene policy as matters to be negotiated with third countries , i know that the most we can expect by way of response is a warm smile .
we can content ourselves with that , but if we do not change our own system too , we will keep on ending up in situations like this one , of having to react to a pandemic which frightens our people and – i say this quite seriously – will of course have an effect on the economy .
as mrs jackson said , most chicken mince ends up in <unk> or in chinese ready meals of one sort or another .
people are unsettled ; they will stop buying these products for a period of time , and that , to a large extent , will of course have an effect on our economy .
the reasons for all this are very simple , and are to be found not only in the hygiene conditions , but also – and let me make this quite clear – in our having been too soft .
as you will recall , commissioner byrne , i called upon you some time ago , when we were discussing dioxin and other products , to announce a ban on imports from china and other countries , simply for disciplinary or educational effect .
then we are always kind and say that these countries must have our support .
that is a mistake .
we will have something to say later on about the european centre on communicable diseases .
you made reference to serious steps , that is , to serious measures and courses of action ; i am sure they will all be marvellous , but only after a few years have passed .
right now , they are no use to us whatever ; right now , the only thing that is any use is to announce that we will protect the people of the european union , for it is for them that we are working in this house .
let us protect them !
are we certain that the viruses that transmit avian influenza among birds and poultry cannot be passed on to human beings ?
have we done enough research ?
that brings me to my next point , and – mr president – it will be my last .
when we are discussing the european union ’s budget and the financial perspective , i always hear a lot said about regional policy , and a lot about aid policy and other matters .
do i even once hear anything said about how we are stringently requiring the member states to ensure that enough research is being done into ways of protecting human beings from disease ?
in that context , never ; nor is it one of the european union ’s priorities .
i would be grateful to you , commissioner byrne , if you could ensure that the financial perspective will include , as one of its priorities , an obligation on the member states to spend money on research into vaccines capable of protecting people against the diseases that may come our way in the future .
– mr president , i too should like to thank the commissioner for the statement he has made .
whilst he , the past few years , has become well-versed in the field of epidemics and animal diseases , the big question is : what have we learnt from them ?
one of the commission 's most important conclusions with regard to the fight against fmd was that the external borders have to be protected .
what has been done about this conclusion ?
when i enter , let us say , amsterdam or dublin , i can still see a major difference in comparison with , to take one example , the united states of america .
in my view , control procedures have hardly changed over the past few years .
i could be wrong , but i should like to hear from the commissioner what specific measures have been taken .
why is it that i read in the paper that at schiphol in amsterdam , disinfectant mats have been put in place , while this is not being done anywhere else in europe ?
why is it that entirely different measures are being taken in belgium ?
what official recommendations does the commission give the member states and how is this advice being acted upon ?
imports from thailand and other countries have been suspended .
this weekend , there were rumours in the dutch press that chicken meat from those countries would enter the european union after all via a side entrance , namely via the new acceding countries .
is this true or not ?
mrs roth-behrendt has already spoken about the need for further research , vaccines and testing methods , among other things .
the point is that this parliament has given the commission the opportunity of using this extra money twice in the past two years .
i am not talking about the resources in category 0 for research , but extra resources in category 0a of the agricultural budget .
the commission has chosen not to spend them .
why not , despite the fact that the self-same commissioner has declared in this plenary that that would be the case ?
the commission has failed to meet a request from the budgetary authority , and i should like to know why that is ?
crisis management : the commission has already stated that there is an emergency plan .
i gather that there are indeed certain plans afoot , but what is the situation as regards human health ?
the flu medicine that could help the public is now available to a limited extent .
has the commission consulted the member states on how it will be used in the different countries if there are inadequate supplies of this medicine in certain other countries ?
finally , a word about the oie .
trade depends on trust and many aspects cannot be monitored by the food and veterinary office in dublin alone , which is dependent on the information that countries pass on to the oie .
it has now transpired that indonesia , vietnam and possibly china , have probably waited many months before informing the oie .
what does the commission intend to do in this context in order to enhance the provision of information , and to ensure that trading can take place under fair conditions , with no risk of our suddenly being faced with illegal imports of products of this kind ?
– mr president , i am quite happy to agree with the commissioner that his staff deserve thanks .
you said , commissioner , that work is being done right now , on the ground , to combat the epidemic .
good though that is , were you on the spot straightaway when the epidemic started ?
were you informed of it then , or only later on when the press picked up the story , and when there was general uproar among us ?
you said , commissioner , that small businesses have been affected , and that this could provide the impetus for industrialisation .
i take the view that it is precisely the moves towards industrialisation that have taken place in these countries that have created the conditions for this pandemic , for they have brought indigenous and adapted breeds into contact with genetically developed breeds that may have adapted to industrialisation but have genetic defects and lack resistance to this disease .
so , if you favour on-the-spot controls in this case , as we do , they must form part of a constant analytical process if these problems are to be addressed .
it is not the small-time poultry farmers who export to the european union , but the large industrial plants , and their standards of hygiene must be equal to our own .
that will not , however , be achieved by having controls at borders or by tightening up the ones that are already in place – and always in a visible way , as the sort of reaction that mrs roth-behrendt described ; what we need instead is special external protection .
what this means is that prevention does not start at the border ; rather , we must impose our standards , and monitor adherence to them , in the countries that supply us , enabling us to guarantee preventative observation and action to reorient production in these countries .
thank you very much .
– mr president , ladies and gentlemen , it seems to us that the current epizootic disease of avian influenza in thailand and south-east asia again raises acutely the question of these new pandemics , with the risks of repeated health crises , as we have seen in the recent past , which have destabilised farmers and also threatened consumers .
we are told today that the whole of south-east asia is affected , with 00 human victims – 00 in vietnam and five in thailand – and 00 million birds slaughtered on the asian continent .
one case has been reported in the united states .
we would like to know , commissioner , what is the likelihood of contamination and to what extent it is possible to say that the virus that has appeared in the us is or is not the same one as has appeared in asia .
i would like to mention a number of precedents : bovine spongiform encephalitis , to which my colleague mr martinez repeatedly tried to draw the commission ’s attention over five years before it burst upon the world in the shape of the famous mad cow affair ; foot and mouth disease in the uk and dioxin-contaminated chicken in belgium .
last year there were cases of avian influenza in the netherlands , not to mention the swine fever that recurs in our countries .
i am glad that we have understood the full extent of the problem right away this time .
as my fellow members have said , however , we also need to deal with the causes .
while the causes of these diseases are sometimes concealed to avoid damaging the industry or turning away the consumer , we do – at least in the previous cases – have a pretty good idea what they are .
we know it was mainly the quest for high yields and high-density farming on the one hand , as the previous speaker said , and , on the other , generalised free trade and the systematic opening of borders .
this theory , which used to be stigmatised as the ‘ free fox in the free <unk> ’ , fits the situation perfectly , the fox here rather symbolising free trade .
not only has it eaten the chicken but , what is far worse , it has contaminated it .
true , the commission has proposed an embargo on imports of thai chicken until august 0000 , but that seems to us inadequate given the scale the phenomenon is assuming .
remember , commissioner , that the commission hauled france before the court of justice in luxembourg for refusing to lift the embargo on british beef when there was no guarantee that the british meat was harmless and bse was still wreaking havoc in the united kingdom and ireland .
france , which produces 0 million tonnes of poultry a year , 00 to 00 % of it for export , could return for a time – and not only france but others too – to traditional markets from which it was ousted by competition from brazil , which practices dumping prices and where , it also appears , production conditions are atrocious .
so much so , incidentally , that europe ’s number one poultry producer , <unk> , has relocated to brazil to take advantage of cheap labour and plentiful raw materials at low prices .
systematic free trade not only destabilises our producers and our poultry farmers , it also forces us , as part of the wto , to accept ridiculous clauses that make you wonder what they have got to do with a free economy and a free market .
i am thinking of the one that was signed at the gatt in 0000 stipulating that europe commits itself to importing 0 % of its poultry meat consumption , or one million tonnes in 0000 .
for the present there has been no transmission of avian influenza between humans , but if there is a risk of a world pandemic and if the h0n0 virus were to combine with a human virus like the flu virus to create a new , highly contagious fatal strain , then i think , commissioner , that the eur 0 million credit you have just announced could prove tragically inadequate .
commissioner byrne , thank you for the explanation , which can almost be seen as an extremely accurate description of the situation .
my speech is , i am sorry to say , based on press information , information which – at least as regards italy – is awakening considerable concerns since , for example , dead peregrine falcons and migratory ducks , two species of a very resistant nature , have been discovered .
i would now like to make two simple and precise comments .
the first concerns the health aspect .
we are not being caught completely unawares by the h0n0 strain , because it was identified back in 0000 and it reappeared as h0n0 between 0000 and 0000 . now , because the strain is continually mutating , we would ask the commission what it intends to do as regards prevention , because – as some members rightly stated before me – we always spring into action after the emergency arises .
some member states are equipped with their own national laboratories , but the european centre for infectious diseases must set up a group to monitor the ways in which the health situation is monitored in the member states .
the second aspect concerns the commission ’s work .
as commissioner lamy announced , there is an extremely serious option , within the talks to revive the wto , aimed at increasing the number of countries involved in the eba initiative .
so then , what are the guarantees offered to our consumers as regards the globalisation of markets ?
does the commission not believe that , on this subject , a think-tank should be set up , within the actual context of the wto , concerning the relationship between globalisation and health problems ?
mr president , commissioner , once again we face a new public health threat .
this illness shows that communicable diseases go beyond the framework of the member states and impose the need for immediate measures which guarantee prevention and protect the health of european citizens .
on 0 february 0000 , the world health organisation pointed out the danger of the flu virus spreading from human to human .
so far 00 people have died , 00 have been contaminated and the virus has emerged in ten asian countries .
not only is the virus highly communicable , but the delay yet again in providing the relevant information has helped it to spread .
the european commission perhaps underestimated the danger , considering that the virus cannot be transmitted from human to human .
however , we know that flu viruses are genetically unstable and their behaviour cannot be predicted .
so this specific epidemic may change quickly and continually .
without question , i welcome the measures taken to ban imports of meat and poultry for six months and imports of live birds as domestic animals from asian countries .
but we must not stop at that , commissioner .
as you well know , the virus is also carried by wild birds as their flocks move .
we need the expertise of the food and agriculture organisation , so that suitable guidelines can be issued and the importance of preventive vaccination , where possible , can be highlighted .
history has taught us that , in cases where a disease has economic repercussions on the agricultural sector and may also harm human health , the risk to man must not be underestimated ; it must take priority if we really want to maintain consumer confidence .
i do not feel that this is what has happened so far with the measures announced .
finally , commissioner , we must be certain that livestock breeders in the areas affected are in a position to obtain suitable means to incinerate animals attacked by the disease without any risk of its spreading .
– commissioner byrne , thank you for your factual explanation , but still , i have to say that i wonder what it is we are actually doing exactly .
indeed , like the liberals , we cannot fail to observe that we do not only have one external border , but fifteen different external borders where assorted attempts are being made at controlling the possible import of avian influenza .
we have witnessed a similar scenario in the case of fmd , and we must take measures in order to prevent a similar situation from occurring again .
i need to get something else off my chest .
if our elderly are at risk of contracting flu , vaccines are available on a massive scale .
in this case too , we know that vaccines are necessary , but nothing , or far too little , is being done about it .
the only country that is working on vaccines is italy .
i think that the european union should make a concerted effort to develop vaccines so that we can combat this disease in a humane manner .
– thank you , mr president .
commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it was almost a year ago exactly that this house discussed sars .
now , as then , many members are saying that globalisation and the european internal market , which are essentially good things , can work well only if we also take action to protect people ’s health .
this is where europe needs to take joint action , for viruses and bacteria do not , after all , stop at borders .
let me pick up mr mulder ’s example .
düsseldorf ’s airport is very , very close to the dutch border , and so it is from düsseldorf that many dutch people fly when they go on holiday , and a lot of people from the part of north rhine-westphalia around düsseldorf fly from schiphol .
people will not understand why safety measures at schiphol have to be quite different from those in düsseldorf .
in any case , viruses do not make a stop at the borders , which are themselves established in different ways by nation-states , and so i believe this is where we need more measures taken at european level .
a year ago , i backed commissioner byrne when he was trying to get more competences to combat this sort of threat included in the european constitution .
admittedly , he does often overshoot the mark , and when he did , i told him so , but , in this case , he really is right , and we should be behind him .
although the convention did not achieve what we actually wanted , progress has been made , and that is another reason to press for a european constitution , which will better enable us to combat these dangers .
i would like to conclude by taking up mrs roth-behrendt ’s point about research .
we do indeed have to do more for medical research , and when we do , we must not think only in terms of products that are capable of being used in the short term .
the protection of people ’s health is a research objective too , one that it is worth pushing , one on which it is worth spending money if there are no firms willing to do it in the short term .
dangers can present themselves without warning , and so we have to be prepared , even if industry has made no effort by the time the danger arises .
mr president , commissioner byrne , i welcome your statement here this morning , but i understand that you went to thailand and were told that it was not avian flu but chicken cholera .
it was only when you returned that you later found that it was actually avian flu .
i welcome the ban you have imposed on thai chicken meat but you have not banned cooked meat or canned meat , and this accounts for about 00 % of our imports from thailand .
the thai authorities have been found wanting in international compliance .
they have hidden the thai flu for maybe two months .
if they protect their market from a deadly disease , surely they will protect it against minor infringements of eu standards .
will they run the same risk with cooked meats ?
will we see nitrofuran residues and hormones entering the eu in this cooked meat ?
is the public health of the eu overridden by the trade interests of eu exporters ?
i believe thailand should be completely <unk> from all poultry meat exports until that country can prove it has the infrastructure and the integrity to apply eu standards all the time .
can we also have a labelling of country of origin for principal ingredients in processed food , because this is where most of this thai cooked meat comes in ?
how can we be sure that meat cooked in thailand has reached the correct temperature ?
there is perhaps a slight risk – how do we know ?
cooked chicken may come into the uk frozen , then thaw and be eaten with no further treatment from the time the <unk> cooked it .
is this a risk to our consumers ?
the tariff for thai cooked chicken meat is one seventh of that on frozen fresh chicken .
why is this so , commissioner ?
this seems to be a loophole .
finally , has the disease moved to the united states of america ?
– mr president , i am grateful to the commissioner for his introduction .
there are actually only a few questions of importance not only to the consumer , but also to the sector itself .
the very first question we have to ask is whether europe finally determined what it is that we do not want to let in .
i sometimes feel sorry for the commissioner , because he can only implement what has been agreed in the member states .
the order did not become valid until 0 february .
this means that the system governing the commission ’s relations with the member states – after all , you cannot always do everything – probably still leaves something to be desired .
moreover , i wonder what the situation is as regards meat , because the order stipulates 0 january as the date on which imports are no longer permitted .
what about meat that has been imported from those countries prior to that date ?
my next question is as follows .
i gather that there is now also a problem in the united states .
admittedly , it is not the real avian influenza as we know it in asia , but it appears to be related .
what do we do with those countries ?
what do the consumers want ?
they want the guarantee that they receive safe products .
they also want sound information , which states that , since you normally do not eat raw meat , chicken meat in a different composition or other method of preparation can do no harm .
let us make sure we can provide this collective information .
a number of members have already mentioned vaccines .
i see this as an area in which europe should develop far more resources and scope in order to act as one .
mr president , northern ireland has a very vibrant poultry industry , which is expressing grave concern .
while what has happened in asia is unfortunate , we have to protect the european market , because it is an extremely large market for the poultry industry .
i am concerned about the length of time it took the authorities in asia to notify us of the outbreak .
this is a very worrying aspect .
i have to ask the commissioner to give serious consideration to the depth of our scrutiny of the chicken asia is producing and exporting to europe .
there is cause for grave concern .
our producers produce chicken and broiler chicken meat of an extremely high standard for the consumers in europe .
but the standard of chicken , not only from the far east but also from other parts of the world , is seriously questionable .
we can sit back on our laurels and wait and see .
before this ban is lifted again , commissioner , i would like your assurance that you will do everything to ensure that our veterinary inspection in the far east where the outbreaks took place is of the highest quality , and we accept no excuses .
i would also raise the point of the import of chicken feathers .
this might not look like a problem , but i am told that it is the most serious way of exporting asian bird flu to europe .
you have to take that on board too when you deal with the chicken meat .
– mr president , i too should like to thank the commissioner for his explanation , but there is a dutch proverb that says : wherever an ass falls , there he will never fall again , or , in other words , ‘ once bitten , twice shy ’ .
it is certainly not my intention to draw a comparison between our commissioner and that animal , but it is absolutely true that the commission is often late in responding to certain epidemics of animal diseases .
we saw this in the case of fmd and we are witnessing it again now .
the commissioner visited thailand in early january and stated there , during his visit , that he was pleased about how the problem was being dealt with and that there was certainly no risk of avian influenza .
meanwhile , one month on , we are in the middle of a worldwide crisis .
we in the cda delegation in this house demand from the commissioner that the line of approach similar to the one we have in the netherlands , the so-called <unk> approach , should be extended europe-wide : a ban on the imports of all poultry , so including cooked meat , from south-east asia , a ban on the imports of ornamental birds , tighter control on flights from asia and disinfectant mats on all international airports with direct or indirect connections to asia .
that is at the moment the only way of warding off this crisis .
in addition , i should like the commissioner to shed light on the rumour that fmd has broken out in 00 towns in vietnam .
we can now fight the problem in good time and , if that is the case , we can ensure that , this time round , adequate measures are taken and we should not wait until the disaster has spread in south-east asia again before we take action .
we are in favour of supporting the asian countries in the fight against avian influenza , but we in europe should not be injecting funds into this while a number of countries ride roughshod over the quarantine measures .
finally , the commission should start a worldwide debate on the fight against animal diseases .
similarly , preventive vaccination should gradually become a subject of discussion worldwide , from the point of view of both public and animal health .
mr president , i welcome our commissioner , mr byrne .
i am deeply concerned about some of the issues that have been raised in this meeting today .
is this a matter of public health or public safety , or is it just a trade issue ?
i strongly believe that this is a matter of public health .
i should like to ask the commissioner how long it took him to decide to ban chicken from coming into the european union ?
is chicken that is still in transit coming into the european union , or has that also been stopped ?
we heard from mr parish that there is a problem of cooked and chilled meats coming in .
why has it not been decided to ban all meats coming in ?
it is said that the flu virus is killed at 00 degrees – given an absolutely perfect situation – but we do not know how these products are cooked .
can you , commissioner , guarantee the safety of children in my constituency ?
for example , schools in <unk> are using thai chicken to prepare meals for the pupils .
can we totally guarantee their safety ?
i have three direct questions for you , commissioner .
what are you doing to ensure the safety of meat coming into this country ?
how many qualified inspectors do we have today on our borders , checking the safety and quality of products coming into the european union ?
you were asked what you were going to do about labelling .
can we guarantee the consumer that labelling will show the country of origin of production ?
it is particularly important that you look at this , commissioner .
this is not just about trade , it is about health .
mr nicholson mentioned feathers .
have you stopped the import of feathers as of today ?
mr president , we are all mindful of the impact on the world ’s population of the atypical pneumonia that raged for much of last year .
the ongoing helplessness of the specialists in the face of this epidemic led to a further sense of insecurity and resulted in a high number of casualties and also a climate of instability in society because it emphasised the deadly risk to anyone contracting the disease .
because i believe that life and health are the most precious assets we have , i must express my concern at this new epidemic : a form of flu whose virus comes from chickens and for which no cure has yet been found .
according to studies published recently by the scientific community , only one thing is certain : this disease is highly contagious .
what can be done to counter it ?
use vaccines ?
how effective are they ?
draw boundaries around neighbourhoods , cities and countries and cut them off from the outside world ?
this is what happened 00 years ago and we all know what the outcome was .
how safe are imports of this meat across the world ?
we all need more complete information at least so that the population at large is not gripped by panic .
we have a duty to ensure that our actions contribute to making health policies accountable , as regards this new disease too , in the face of which we feel powerless .
we must find out whether other animals in our food chain are equally at risk , because a few days ago pigs were said to be amongst the animals most vulnerable to this type of virus .
to allay these legitimate concerns , all the necessary means must be made available to prevent and treat this epidemic .
mr president , the european union must raise concerns about the unhealthy practices that have developed alongside the industrialisation and mass transportation of livestock in parts of asia .
animal disease now travels far and fast in types of farming and food distribution .
that makes it very difficult to control .
in the age of global trade , retailers and manufacturers source their raw materials where they are cheapest , and the european poultry industry has struggled to compete with prices from south-east asia and brazil , where labour costs are very much lower .
the uk alone imported 00 000 tonnes of poultry meat from thailand in the first ten months of last year , a 00 % increase on the previous year .
but in the light of this flu virus we must maintain the strictest food safety standards here in the european union , ensuring that all imports meet those very same high standards .
modern food systems mean that animal diseases travel far and travel quickly .
the outbreak of avian flu in the netherlands last year illustrated how hard the disease can be to contain .
does the commission believe that all health authorities in the european union would spot avian flu and be able to react decisively enough if it arrived on this continent ?
mr president , i have been asked a number of questions and i will endeavour to answer as many as possible .
first , mrs jackson asks whether i am satisfied with the inspection services that we have , particularly in relation to our work in asia .
in relation to the fvo , i should say that i have not sent the fvo to thailand in respect of this particular outbreak .
the experts who are there , who have been offered by me , have been supplying their services through the world health organisation and are in place working with the oie , in vietnam particularly .
the fvo will be involved in this exercise only when it is believed there is something profitable to be gained from it , that is in circumstances where there is the possibility of lifting the ban .
i have made it clear on a number of occasions publicly that it is not my intention to lift this ban on the importation of thai chicken until such time as there is an independent evaluation of the situation there , in view of the history that a number of you have referred to .
the evaluation will be made as a result of a visit from the inspectors of the fvo and following a report from them as to the situation .
mrs jackson also asked me whether , in view of the likelihood of concealment , we are getting good information and whether we have a proper rapid response team in place .
as i indicated in my earlier remarks , there is in existence an early warning response system .
this system is in place , working from luxembourg , and has been in operation for some time .
you will remember when i reported to parliament last year on the sars issue , i also pointed to the work of this committee .
there is a communicable diseases network which also works in conjunction with the relevant authorities in the member states .
i am absolutely satisfied that the system of rapid response that we have in relation to animal and human diseases is very effective .
you will remember the very quick response of the commission and my services to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease some years ago , when the commission responded within a matter of hours and all the relevant authorities and member states knew within a matter of hours that there had been this outbreak in the united kingdom .
the same is true of public health because we have this system in place .
mention was also made of the next item on parliament 's agenda : the legislation establishing the european centre for disease prevention and control .
i can assure parliament that the evidence is there that the commission and other institutions of the european union are working well to respond quickly to these kinds of issues and to give proper information to the public and , indeed , to respond well and appropriately to outbreaks of this kind .
on the question of food labelling , there is community law in place relating to labelling .
it may need upgrading and i am looking at that .
the legislation in place requires country of origin labelling and certification and stamps from countries such as thailand .
so , if cooked chicken from thailand comes pre-packed it has a stamp on it which indicates that and the label also states the country of origin which , as i indicated in this case , is thailand .
mrs roth-behrendt asked me if we are doing enough in respect of avian flu and , in particular , blocking food products from asia .
it is important to emphasise that we do not trade in any poultry products with any country in asia other than thailand , so the responses given relate to that country .
of course we are concerned about the outbreak of animal and bird diseases in other parts of the world and we make sure that we respond properly to those issues .
as a number of people mentioned during this debate , we must not lose sight of the fact that we have had these outbreaks of avian influenza in the european union also .
we had an outbreak in italy two or three years ago ; we had an outbreak in the netherlands last year ; there have been outbreaks in belgium and germany too .
mrs roth-behrendt also asked me what i am doing about imports from china .
it is public knowledge that we banned imports from china some years ago ; there was a lot of publicity about that at the time .
there are a number of food products we do not import from china , including poultry .
on the question of research into vaccinations , this is being done – dg research does have a research programme on food safety .
on this same subject which mrs roth-behrendt and others referred to , an informal meeting of the health ministers of the eu and accession countries will be taking place in brussels on thursday evening .
one of the items on the agenda is the question of the stockpiling of vaccines in respect of diseases of this kind , of which flu is obviously one .
we had a discussion in parliament last year on appropriate responses to the bioterrorism issue , such as stockpiling vaccines against smallpox .
there is ongoing work in relation to that also .
however , i must emphasise , as mr liese has said , that the competences available to us at european union level in respect of public health issues are quite limited .
an attempt was made to extend these competences in the european convention and we made some progress .
i still have hopes that we might ultimately make more progress on this before the finalisation of the constitution .
mr mulder asked me about the inspection systems .
in his opinion inspections are not carried out at the same level for products coming in from outside the european union .
under commission decision 0000/000/ec , all personal imports of meat in the luggage of passengers from asia have been banned with the exception of small amounts of specialist food products , such as baby food .
under these rules , poultry meat and meat products carried by passengers cannot be introduced into the eu without conforming to the same health requirements as commercial imports .
as i said earlier , no commercial imports of poultry meat are allowed from any asian country where the disease is present .
mr graefe zu baringdorf then asked me whether i reacted quickly or only when the press publicised this issue .
as has been indicated by a number of other speakers , i was in asia when this outbreak became public .
i had been in vietnam , from where we do not import any poultry meat , so the issue does not arise there .
but i had also been in thailand .
it is public knowledge that in the early part of the week when i was there , there was some lack of transparency , if could express it in that way .
i was concerned during the couple of days i was there at the mounting circumstantial evidence tending in the other direction .
following pressing questions from me , it was made clear to me two or three days later that in fact avian flu was present , both in the human and bird populations .
i am satisfied that my presence in thailand helped to improve transparency in relation to this issue .
as soon as the presence of avian flu was confirmed to me on 00 january , i put a ban in place within a matter of hours .
the ban went in place on that friday at 00 o'clock , brussels time .
any suggestion that the commission reacted slowly is incorrect .
i cannot imagine any greater degree of surveillance or monitoring than the commissioner being there himself , asking questions , not being satisfied with the answers , pressing further , getting the truth and acting within hours .
mr gollnisch asked me about the risk of contamination of the united states virus .
it is believed , but not yet confirmed , that this virus is a low pathogenic virus and therefore would not require the same degree of response as for the asian influenza from thailand .
however , that is not confirmed , we are still looking at it and our response will depend on our information .
i assure him that the lifting of the ban will only take place after independent evaluation of the circumstances .
mr fiori asked me about pet birds and other birds .
a ban has been put in place in respect of the importation of pet birds .
he asked me about coordinating groups .
there is a regulatory committee of the eu , which includes member states ' experts , who deal with that .
he asked me about links between globalisation and diseases .
the oie in paris continues evaluating the situation .
the commission is a member of that , member states are involved .
they are meeting later this month in relation to this issue .
the sps agreement is also a relevant contributor to the protection of animal and public health in relation to the wto issues .
mr de roo asked me about borders .
once again , i refer back to the lack of competences that we have in relation to borders and communicable diseases , but i hope more progress will be made on this .
i refer him also to my earlier answer that the health ministers are meeting later this week to deal with many of the issues that he raised about the public health aspect and in particular vaccinations .
mr parish said that it was only when i returned that i discovered there was a problem and that i reacted well .
as i indicated earlier , that was not the case ; i reacted while i was there and the commission responded well to this issue .
we have not banned cooked meats for the reasons that have been stated .
i am advised that cooked meats above 00 degrees – and we put in a safety margin of another 00 degrees – are safe for human consumption .
the inspectors in the european union , and in the member states themselves , know what is necessary and carry out appropriate inspections to ensure that there are no breaches of community law in relation to this issue .
he also referred to labelling and i refer him to my earlier answer .
mrs oomen-ruijten asked me whether we followed the member states ' lead in this .
the actual chronology of events is that on 00 january the commission put in place the ban in circumstances i have already outlined ; member states responded with the regulatory committee confirming that ban on 0 february ; and a further ban was put in place in respect of feathers – mr nicholson asked me about that – on 00 january .
mr sturdy asked me how long it took for the ban to be put in place .
i have already answered that question .
there were a number of questions in relation to the number of inspectors at the border posts .
this is a member state competence .
the member states themselves make sure that they have enough officials to ensure that the importation is properly inspected .
the food and veterinary office inspectors monitor this when they carry out their inspections .
they report , and the reports are public .
there are no reports of any concerns in relation to this .
on labelling , i refer you to my earlier answer .
concerning feathers , again i refer you to my earlier answer : that ban has been in place since 00 january .
mrs cardoso made reference to the vulnerability of pigs and i would confirm that this is a concern and is being watched very closely .
there have been reports of some infection found in the noses of some pigs in vietnam , but it has not extended any further and there has been no evidence of mutation of the flu virus .
this is , however , being watched very closely because of the similarity between the immune system of pigs and of humans .
therefore , as she rightly points out , it is of considerable concern .
mr wyn asked me whether the health authorities are doing everything that they can to stop the spread of this disease .
i am impressed by the work undertaken by my own staff .
i have had detailed consultations and briefings and i am satisfied that their own work , their interaction with the who , the fao and the oie , and also their interaction with the experts in the member states , indicate to me that this issue is being taken very seriously , that the officials , at both national and international level , understand the seriousness of this and that they are doing everything in their power to ensure that the disease is not spread .
one of the difficulties being faced in some poorer areas is that the <unk> of the disease is best achieved by killing the birds in question .
this is of course a matter of concern in poor countries , because unless the authorities involved face up to the question of compensation there is a risk that a disease of this kind may be hidden .
that may be a contributing factor to the earlier lack of full transparency about this issue in that part of the world .
this has to be faced and we have to emphasise it in our relations with the authorities in member states .
these kinds of diseases cannot be hidden , their presence will come out , will be known , and the consequences ultimately will be worse for those countries who engage in that exercise , because they undermine the confidence of the authorities engaged in food safety , like ours in the european union .
the stringent measures necessary before the ban is lifted in thailand , with the requirement that there will be independent evaluation , will be particularly necessary in this instance because of the lack of transparency at an earlier stage .
we must be assured that our own authorities are satisfied , which is why no lifting of the ban in thailand will take place until the fvo has carried out an inspection on the ground and reported back that things are satisfactory .
– mr president , on a point of order , i have asked the commissioner about the rumour of the fmd outbreak in 00 towns in vietnam that are also plagued by avian influenza .
i have not had an answer to this question from the commissioner .
i should like to know whether the commissioner has any information on this .
. mr president , we are watching the situation in vietnam very carefully and in particular the spread of this disease there .
there may be a risk that the outbreak of the disease there is more serious and more widespread than in thailand .
i believe that to be the case .
i must emphasise that we do not import any poultry from vietnam , so there is no risk to public health .
there is no risk to animal health from direct importation from vietnam and therefore our concern in this relates to ensuring the containment of the spread of the disease in asia itself as a matter of general interest , but it is not related to any further risk as a result of any importation of birds , because we do not engage in that kind of trade with vietnam .
mr president , the commissioner has been very elaborate in his answer , but he has avoided answering one essential question .
under heading 0a in the 0000 and 0000 budgets this parliament and the council have twice provided for extra funds to be set aside for research into better vaccines and testing methods .
the commission was at liberty to decline that wish of parliament .
in the light of present developments , is the commission prepared to investigate the possibility of using funds from heading 0a for research into vaccines and testing methods and inform this house as soon as possible of the outcome of these deliberations ?
it is urgent that we do something , and the commission should not ignore the resolutions of this parliament in this respect , nor the budget itself .
. i know that mr mulder is interested in this matter and that he has had direct contact with my cabinet about it as recently as in the last few days .
the items he mentions as requiring financing are being financed .
the question is : under what heading will they be dealt with ?
if it is believed to be necessary to transfer from one budget heading to another and that this is the best way of dealing with it , then this can be done .
this matter is under review .
however , it is important to emphasise that the items he mentions as requiring financing are not being under-financed .
they are being financed .
whatever refinement may be necessary in the future can be dealt with at that time .
– mr president , i do not want to respond to what the commissioner has said here , but simply to know when the minutes of yesterday ’s sitting will be adopted since i know they are not yet available .
will it be at the start of this afternoon ’s sitting or at some other time ?
– it will be at the start of this afternoon ’s sitting , at 0 p.m. .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place today at 00.00 a.m. .
the next item is the report ( α0-0000 / 0000 ) by mr bowis , on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , on the european centre for disease prevention and control .
. i am pleased to be here to discuss the commission ’s proposal for a regulation to establish a european centre for disease prevention and control , submitted to the council and the european parliament in august 0000 .
allow me first to express my gratitude to the rapporteur , mr bowis , and the members of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy for all their hard work and support on this important and urgent proposal .
the sars emergency in the early spring of 0000 served as a sharp reminder of the need to accelerate the further development of our capacity to deal with health threats .
the current epidemic of avian influenza in asia – that we have just discussed – with its potential risk to public health , reinforces the need for prompt and effective action .
the existing community network for surveillance and control of communicable diseases is a solid basis on which we can build – to enhance cooperation between the member states , the commission and international organisations , in particular the world health organisation .
we need to have the means at our disposal to respond to emerging health threats based on the best scientific advice , in the shortest possible time .
establishment of the centre marks the shift from ad hoc cooperation to structured coordination through a focal point , giving clear scientific leadership .
in some recent cases , in response to who requests for help , we have seen teams from different member states investigating the same phenomena with slightly different methodologies , sending samples to different laboratories , with each of them reporting separately .
this divergence would end with the creation of a scientifically reputable centre with the authority to act at community level on matters such as surveillance , networking of expert laboratories or mobilising outbreak investigation teams .
the commission ’s text takes into account budgetary rigour and respects the member states ’ responsibilities on public health .
at first , the centre 's core task will be to deal with communicable diseases from whatever source – deliberate or adventitious .
the question of extending its mandate subsequently should be addressed on the basis of experience .
i very much hope that we can reach a speedy agreement between the institutions – during first reading – to enable the centre to become operational as soon as possible .
mr president , when i present reports to this parliament i like to add by way of a signature a quotation and in this case i have used the arabian proverb : ' he who has health has hope , and he who has hope has everything ' . the statement and the debate we have just been listening to show the hopes and the fears of our constituents and their concern that we do better in this area in the future .
in the case of avian flu , with the transmission from hens to ducks to pigs to humans – resulting in the deaths of 00 humans – mutation is a possibility .
when we look back at the sars experience and when we look around at the constant threat of bioterrorism , we see the need for this centre to coordinate better , as the commissioner has said , and we see the need for urgency in bringing this measure forward .
we are dealing with health emergencies that are within the competence of the european union .
we are also dealing with other health areas and starting , as the commissioner has said , with communicable diseases , not least those with <unk> strains , which threaten our communities .
this report provides for a later review in three years ' time , which will look at the scope of the measure and the experience gained and see how best we can move forward in terms of other health monitoring .
the centre does not resemble the american central direction center , but is rather a network of networks .
it is neither bureaucratic , nor is it costly .
in due course , we may need to look at its costs to see if we are adequately funding it , but for now it is certainly not costly .
it will work closely with national networks and no national network need feel threatened by this because they will fully be a part of it .
it will also work with international agencies , particularly the who , which is so fundamental in these areas .
in our discussions we have had two key issues before us .
one was the scope , where we found a happy and acceptable solution , and the other was the board , where there was some controversy .
i am one of those who has always argued for small boards for these authorities and agencies , as i did for the food safety authority , but in this case there is a fundamental reason why we need to have every member state represented on the board and that is because every member state may be asked to contribute to the work of the centre .
that is sensible .
i am grateful also that we have been able to ensure that we have parliamentary representation on the board .
it is urgent that this set-up should be in place by 0000 and for that reason we have to do this in a single reading , given the complexities of the parliamentary year ahead .
it has been a complex process of consultation with colleagues and with the council that has led to a complex set of mainly technical and linguistic amendments .
we now have two blocks of amendments ; the first are those that i commend to this house , and the second those that are superseded by the first .
there are then two further amendments tabled by the eldr group and i have to say to the house that , whatever one thinks of those amendments , were they to be accepted it would jeopardise the possibility of having this measure brought forward by 0000 .
i therefore have to ask the house to reject those two amendments .
this report has only been possible because of the collaboration with my colleagues in my group and across the groups , and i am deeply grateful to them , to the shadow rapporteurs , to the group , the committee and the parliamentary secretariats .
our discussions and debates have also played a role , including those with the commission and the council , which have often been forceful , yet always positive .
i am grateful both to the former italian presidency and the current irish presidency for the work we have been able to do together .
this proposal will enhance our community and national ability to look after public health throughout the european union .
it will enable us to work with other countries beyond the european union to prevent , control and defeat the health threats that we face today .
i commend this measure to the house .
– mr president , commissioner , i would like first of all to offer my warmest congratulations to the rapporteur .
obviously i am going to say how urgent we believe it is for this european centre for disease prevention and control to be set up .
this is also apparent from the discussions we have just had this morning and those we had last year at a time when the health threats were severe .
we need to put a system in place that will enable us to respond both effectively and swiftly because , as everyone knows , diseases know no borders .
not to mention that the risks of propagation are all the greater for exchanges between people and movements to the four corners of the globe being increasingly frequent .
finally , the potential threat of bioterrorism means we need to be particularly vigilant .
having said that , we must not worry the public , but rather prevent risk and put in place every possible means of detection and rapid response .
such an approach therefore requires very close coordination between the member states and concerted action to pool resources , competences and knowledge .
with this european centre for disease prevention and control we are establishing a europe of immune defence .
i therefore hope that this centre will be able to provide objective and easy to understand information about health risks for the public at large and in particular that it will be operational as soon as possible .
we must not delay but work to see that it is set up .
in this regard , everyone must show a sense of responsibility , at all costs avoiding – and this is perhaps where i differ slightly from the rapporteur – potential conflicts arising from interests associated with national representation , for example .
this centre is not in fact intended to replace the national authorities but to help them to network , obviously , with the competent community agencies like the european food safety authority , the european drugs agency and , of course , all the national authorities .
as regards the choice of headquarters , i hope it will be as operational as possible and that we will avoid fruitless arguments .
none of this , though , will do any good unless we apply our european research efforts to all these health questions .
as we are always saying in this chamber – my fellow member mrs roth-behrendt said it just now – we would like the member states to listen to us at last .
mr president , commissioner , recent developments in the health sector have shown that one member state alone , even if it has all the necessary means , cannot efficiently address all the threats .
the transmission of epidemics is facilitated by movements of populations , environmental and social changes , globalisation and war .
the community , alongside its obligations which derive from the treaties , must also respond to citizens ' concerns .
that is why the creation of a centre which will focus on prompt diagnosis and on evaluating and publicising existing and re-emerging risks to public health in a fast , flexible and efficient manner is long overdue .
the european centre for disease prevention and control will coordinate and reinforce the work of the european commission , the member states and the network for epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases .
it will operate in cooperation with all the existing services involved in public health , such as the world health organisation and the european food safety authority .
on behalf of my group , mr president , and following recent developments – i refer to the previous debate which we had on bird flu – i should like to emphasise that we agree with the rapporteur 's proposal to close the matter at first reading and for the centre to open in 0000 , even if we are not entirely satisfied with the council 's positions .
however , i should like to thank the rapporteur for accepting my proposals to extend the scope of the regulation to other serious health threats and not just communicable diseases .
i should also like to thank him because he accepted the need for the repercussions of recent epidemics on both physical and mental health to be recorded and handled appropriately .
for funding , commissioner , it is vital that the centre have its own line in the budget and appropriations which will allow it to respond to its difficult mission .
finally , i should like to congratulate and thank the rapporteur once again .
– mr president , commissioner , as others have already said , a little under a year ago in this very place , when the sars epidemic was at its height , we called for the creation of a european centre to deal with modern day epidemics ; so far as its tasks were concerned , at any rate , it would be modelled on the atlanta <unk> .
obviously this was something that needed to be done at european level , first and foremost because no fewer than 00 new emergent and fatal viruses have appeared since 0000 , viruses that know no frontiers and move as fast as an aeroplane : aids , the ebola virus , the west nile virus , sars , to name but a few .
it is something that needs to be done at european level , too , because this is where europe ’s health must be defended whenever that can and must be done better here than at the other levels , be it local authorities , regions or states .
and that is clearly the case now , when we are having to combat these viruses that are transmissible to man .
the epidemic of atypical pneumonia has confirmed the courage of those researchers and doctors who have risked their lives to alert the international community , and even if europe has escaped relatively unscathed in this case , we must remain vigilant .
sars has not been wiped out and , as many have said this morning , other viruses are lying in wait for a new mutation that will make the leap to man , like bird flu .
that is why common sense , the relevance of the proposals made by our rapporteur , mr bowis – whom i also want to thank warmly here – and the quality of the compromise reached with the irish presidency require that tomorrow we applaud the rapid creation of this european centre for disease prevention and control .
as i was saying , this organisation will have many precise and vital tasks : the ability to respond swiftly to a viral epidemic or one deliberately caused by a bioterrorist attack , information to the public on all the risks of contamination , greater international cooperation , chiefly with the who of course .
this centre will also – and i am not the first to say or reiterate it today – ( and why not ? ) have to create a european network of laboratories and contribute to the search for vaccines for these diseases that are still resistant to antibiotics .
the marketing of an antiviral vaccine or antiviral drugs is always a race against the clock and sometimes takes decades .
that is why it is essential that we continue to invest as much in screening tests , i should say , as in inactivation technologies .
in this connection , i note commissioner byrne ’s commitment – as he said just now – to push the limits of the treaty as far as he can in the matter .
meanwhile , in the short term , in 0000 that is , the europe of the 00 will have its disease prevention and control centre , and we must look beyond that very strong signal to the sign of a europe of health that is advancing .
mr president , i would like to begin by complimenting mr bowis on the professionalism , determination and timeliness with which he concluded the drafting of this important report .
i also congratulate the rapporteur on his immense efforts in negotiations with the council to reach an agreement at first reading .
i believe , in fact , that it is of the utmost importance that the centre is operational as soon as possible in order to guarantee the health monitoring and the rapid alert system which must be provided by the union in order adequately to tackle the challenges brought about by its imminent enlargement and by a globalised world which is increasingly unprotected against the spread of diseases still unknown to us : sars in 0000 and the very recent bird flu are specific examples .
i therefore consider that 0 january 0000 has to be the ultimate deadline for the launch of this centre .
another point that i would like to stress is the initial and refresher training for all health personnel in the member states of the union , and the centre should be responsible for this .
ready for the entrance of ten new countries , the union should aim to provide all health systems with the instruments , means and knowledge to create an effective synergy between all member states and , in that way , to guarantee the coherence of the union ’s action proposed by the centre .
i will conclude by mentioning that the ability to respond adequately to an international health threat depends , to a large extent , on pre-emptively adopting preparatory plans for rapid action , coordinated at european level .
the centre should provide this essential service .
mr president , today is an important milestone because , after many years of debate and findings on the need to reinforce the union 's ability to take prompt , coordinated action on public health threats , we are finally discussing the setting up of the european centre for disease prevention and control .
over the last twenty years , there have been reports of thirty new infectious diseases , or variations on old diseases caused by mutating viruses , or even the re-emergence of old diseases such as tuberculosis , to give but one example .
all these crises in the public health sector , such as sars and bird flu recently , have highlighted the weaknesses and gaps in existing structures .
i hope that the centre , with its small but adequate scientific operating structure , will be able to plug these gaps efficiently .
however , if its work is to be satisfactory and efficient , it must be the central reference and coordination point for all the national surveillance centres and reference centres and laboratories of the member states .
i should like to thank the rapporteur because not only did he accept the amendments which i proposed but , subsequently , in conjunction with them , two very important issues were approved and accepted which had not been included in the initial proposal .
the first concerns the development of the strategy of vaccinations , which are an extremely important weapon in combating the threat from infections diseases .
the second relates to the identification of topical public health issues and the promotion of the relevant , applied research , in order to reinforce our preventive capabilities and promote the efficiency of the coordinated action taken .
mr president , i hope that we will also overcome these final hesitations and that the centre will soon be up and running , even in its present , restricted form .
– thank you , mr president ; ladies and gentlemen , i shall try to avoid repeating what has already been said , and also to avoid taking a diversion into discussing communicable diseases such as influenza , viruses and so on .
mr bowis started his speech by saying that ‘ he who has health has hope , and he who has hope has everything ’ .
in that case , this morning , i feel very rich , for i have everything .
i have hope , and that is everything .
i have little more than that .
i hope that the centre we are discussing today will very soon become operational .
mrs grossetête gave a very clear description of what this centre will have to be able to do in order to be effective .
in essence , it will have to square the circle .
although this involves squaring a circle , i do have hope , and so , like mr bowis , i have everything .
i cannot do other than agree wholeheartedly with mrs grossetête when she says that it is important that we do our work quickly , that it is important that we get things up and running .
it follows , though , that the people who work there will have to be highly independent , work in very unconventional ways and possess imagination and the ability to work on their own initiative .
by no means everyone can do these things .
looking at a number of other authorities that we have set up over the past few years , i have to say that their success is not exactly self-evident .
now there is the possibility of us coming to a different conclusion .
as my fellow-members have spoken about this centre in great detail , i have to say what i would have liked to have seen .
hope , in my mind , is associated with aspiration .
of course communicable diseases are important , and of course the fight against them is important in terms of protecting the citizens of this european union of ours , but let us be clear-sighted about the fact that most people in the european union do not die of communicable diseases ; they die of cancer , of heart attacks , and of strokes .
how is it that it is a matter of chance whether you survive a heart attack , depending on whether you live in berlin or in madrid , or somewhere else ?
how is it that best practice in the treatment of cancer cases is not as yet established and communicated in the european union ?
i regard that as an intolerable state of affairs .
i wish we had been more ambitious and had said that the least we need is to link up best practice within the european union in order to fight the real diseases that we have to cope with at the moment .
networking would have been within the competence of the european union , and we could have afforded it .
we did not manage it the first time round , but i hope we will , at the second attempt , ensure that people ’s recovery from serious illness is not a matter of chance and does not depend on whether they live in the north , the south , the heart of germany or on its plains , or in some other part of the european union .
thank you .
mr president , my colleague , john bowis , never lets us down .
he not only nourishes our souls with the aphorism he chooses in each of his reports , but he also ensures that the report is clear , detailed and balanced .
such is the case this time too .
the agency for communicable diseases will be an immensely important body in the union as infectious diseases have proved to be a major safety risk .
with the enormous publicity they attract , they must be a significant factor in the insecurity the public feel .
bird flu has been a conspicuous topic of discussion recently , and aids is still <unk> , to say nothing of older communicable diseases such as tuberculosis .
furthermore , the threat of bioterrorism is unfortunately a real one , as the anthrax letters we saw in 0000 showed .
under the treaties the eu has a clear obligation here , and there are functional reasons that reinforce it : joint action in the preservation of public health and prevention of disease is more effective .
for that reason , the aim to start the work of the agency promptly next year is absolutely the right one , and the report by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy is firmly in favour of this aim .
the regulation under discussion thus intends to establish the agency promised for sweden in the package agreed at the european council in december .
i would hope the farce over the multiannual aspect of the decision on the package will later on mean there will be an amendment to the decision-making process ; although the decision to establish the new agency is obviously governed by the requirement of consensus in the council , such a detail as its geographical location should be decided by a majority .
as far as the balance of competences of the union and the member states is concerned , only the former system has importance .
the latter only gives rise to national chauvinism , and that should be curbed where possible by revising the decision-making structures .
mr president , the creation of a european centre for disease prevention and control has never been so important .
the recent sars outbreak , the current threat of a biological terrorist attack and even the current asian bird flu crisis illustrate the threat from disease in the global village that we live in today .
the threat to europe 's health from the rapid spread of disease is real and present .
every year 0.0 billion passengers fly on an international trip .
every one of them could pose a threat to global health security .
if they were found to be carrying a new strain of influenza or sars they could within a few hours unwittingly put the lives of millions at risk .
global warming threatens even britain with diseases such as malaria , while diseases such as tb are already returning .
the correct response is not to turn our backs on the benefits of globalisation – we should not give up the opportunities presented by increases in trade and travel because of biological threats any more than for reasons of terrorism – but we need coordinated action .
in today 's world no one country can afford to go it alone .
that is why labour meps so firmly back these proposals for a european centre for disease prevention and control .
when it comes to tackling disease , europe works .
the european commission was able to ban chicken imports from countries affected by the new strain of bird flu with immediate effect .
without the eu , it would have required an enormous effort to coordinate the actions of all 00 – and soon 00 – member states .
we need to strengthen that coordination and not weaken it through isolation .
so i am pleased that tory meps will also back this plan today .
however , i wonder how they can square that with their own hostility to europe and their policy of attacking the eu at every turn .
the centre will contribute to the improvement and strengthening of the prevention and monitoring of human diseases in the eu .
its technical work and research capabilities will be an asset , as will the work with the who .
i agree that accessibility to information for the public is vital , and that is why the centre should have its own website to communicate its work and to publish its opinions .
this is one of the eu 's success stories , and we should be celebrating its creation .
– mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to echo the thanks expressed to the rapporteur , mr bowis .
he really did have a very difficult brief , for initially it was not clear at all that our proposal would meet with general approval ; the german federal government , for example , was very sceptical at first .
mrs stihler may like to note that it was , in this respect , more eurosceptic than the british conservatives .
mr bowis has managed to handle such a controversial topic in such a way that we are on the verge of reaching agreement , and that it really is possible to bring this matter to a conclusion at first reading and before enlargement .
i think it was and is inconsistent for the european union to have very strong competences when it comes to dealing with the diseases of animals , and to be able to take direct action , but that the same is not the case as regards the combating of diseases that affect human beings , and that , when human health is endangered , the first thing said is the magic word ‘ subsidiarity ’ .
i am all in favour of subsidiarity ; i am not in favour of a european <unk> , nor of total harmonisation of health care provision , but this is where european action is right , as we saw from the many examples given in this morning ’s debate on avian influenza .
whilst we have to use the member states ’ competences , this is something we have to bring together at the european level .
i think it right that we should take a pragmatic approach , by starting with communicable diseases – which are the most urgent problem at the moment – and then see where we go from there .
i also think what mr trakatellis said was very important , namely that joint debate and the development of vaccination policies must be priorities .
my final comment is addressed to the council , represented here not by ministers but by officials . many members of this house have made reference to bio-terrorism .
over three months ago , i addressed a question on this issue to the council , which it should , in the normal course of events , have answered after six weeks .
i am still awaiting a reply .
bio-terrorism is too important an issue for us to allow ourselves such delays .
. mr president , this interesting debate highlights the urgency and importance of this proposal .
the political pressure to have the centre set up and running as soon as possible reflects the needs and concerns of european citizens .
for the europe of today , where millions of people cross national borders every day , we need to be in a position to take rapid , coordinated action at eu level to best protect the health of our citizens .
this is precisely what the centre aims to achieve .
by pooling our scientific expertise and reinforcing our rapid alert systems , the ecdc will allow better preparation and swifter and more effective responses to disease outbreaks .
in summing up this morning 's debate , i would like to focus on three central issues in the proposal which have been key areas of concern : the mission and the tasks of the centre ; the possible extension of its sphere of operation ; and the composition of the management board .
there is broad agreement between the institutions on the initial scope of the centre .
we all agree that it should start with communicable diseases and be able to respond to cases of unexpected outbreaks of unknown origin .
the council and parliament share the view that there needs to be an external evaluation to assess the feasibility of extending the scope based on the performance and impact of the centre , as resources permit .
clearly , the budget for the centre will dictate its expansion , and beyond 0000 this has to be decided within the new financial perspectives .
to enable the centre to start , and for it to make an impact , the commission is prepared to accept this approach , but it means that when the question of the need to extend its remit arises we should – and would – expect parliament and the council to address such a proposal rapidly , under the codecision procedure .
as regards the organisational aspects of the centre , the proposal provides for responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the centre to be granted to the director .
the advisory forum is the place for the director to seek advice from his or her peers – and the forum would ensure the shared ownership of this venture with the member states .
the commission can accept the extension of the membership of the advisory forum to stakeholders such as non-governmental organisations and academics .
it will be an advantage for the director to have broader views when developing the operation of the centre .
the management board should steer policy and make decisions .
the commission ’s proposal balances this dual responsibility in a way which we consider to be the most efficient and transparent .
this approach is based on the principles defined in the commission communication on the governance of european agencies .
in a resolution adopted last month , parliament welcomed this communication , recognising the need to limit the size of the boards of the agencies .
the commission wants to follow a consistent approach on this matter , as currently each agency seems to follow a different path .
i now note that the council and parliament have reached agreement on a board for the ecdc to consist of one representative per member state , three from the commission and two from parliament .
the commission considers that a board of 00 members is unwieldy and may hamper the decision-making process .
although , given the competences involved and being exercised here , i agree with the rapporteur that a good case can be made for one member per member state being on the board .
the commission notes , however , the terms of the compromise supported by council and parliament and is therefore willing , despite our concerns , to go along with this compromise , given the importance that it attaches to the rapid establishment of the centre .
the commission notes that the evaluation provided for in article 00 of the regulation will cover the working practises of the centre , including the composition and functioning of the management board .
a full listing of the commission ’s position on each of the amendments is being made available to parliament ( 0 ) .
in short , this states that the commission accepts all amendments that are part of the compromise package as set out by the rapporteur .
i also join with the rapporteur in urging that amendments the package should not – and cannot – be accepted by the commission .
i conclude by thanking the rapporteur and parliament .
when i formulated this idea in my mind some years ago , i not only got the support that i would expect from my own services , but also very strong support from parliament .
we should be proud of ourselves today .
by voting tomorrow on this issue we are reacting in a timely way in circumstances where we see communicable diseases on a global basis .
we have discussed it in the last debate here in parliament .
we can proudly say to our citizens that we are responding well and quickly to their needs in relation to issues associated with communicable disease .
sometimes we can be unduly pessimistic and critical of ourselves .
this is one occasion where we can stand up and say that we have done our work well and quickly , we have responded to the needs , and we can look our citizens in the eye and tell them that we have done our work well .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place today at 00.00 a.m. .
the next item is the report ( α0-0000 / 0000 ) by mr garot , on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development , on trends in agricultural incomes in the european union .
. – mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the purpose of the own-initiative report on agricultural incomes is to help us review the implementation of the european agricultural model based on multifunctionality and the competitiveness of farms .
incomes are in fact the barometer of the viability of farms .
without sufficient incomes , farmers disappear and production moves away from the most fragile areas .
but if farmers are eliminated and concentration accelerates , we risk moving away from the european model we advocate , which involves the presence of farmers on all territories .
the analysis of incomes is therefore of obvious interest .
the relevant findings for the period 0000 to 0000 are as follows .
firstly , the average agricultural income in the europe of the 00 rose by 0 % with large national variations , for example +00 % in portugal and – 00 % in the united kingdom .
secondly , public support accounts for more than 00 % of this figure , but its distribution is debatable .
twenty percent of farms receive 00 % of aids for 00 % of areas and 00 % of employment .
thirdly , producer prices fell by 0.0 % while consumer prices rose 00 % .
fourthly , the slight improvement in this average income comes from the fact that the cake is shared between fewer and fewer farmers since the number of people working in this sector fell by 00.0 % over the same period .
we must therefore ask ourselves whether the phenomenon can be allowed to continue without jeopardising our european model of agriculture .
this question is all the more serious because the application of multifunctionality is going to result in higher production costs even though public support is set to decline for farmers of the 00 member states between now and 0000 , chiefly because of the rise in community support for agriculture in the ten new countries .
the european union cannot remain indifferent to this situation .
we need to give some thought to the direction of future changes to the cap to make it consistent with the two objectives of multifunctionality and competitiveness which we have set for farms .
from this point of view , the market must tend to reward the act of agricultural production . as for public support , it must increasingly go to pay for the non-market services that agriculture performs for society .
the most recent cap reform includes positive steps forward in this direction , especially with the conditionality and modulation of aids .
with decoupling , though , the cap is establishing historically acquired rights that will have the effect of preventing remuneration for multifunctionality for all farms on all territories .
it is therefore absolutely essential to get away from these historical rights , something that will be possible gradually if modulation is substantially increased .
on the matter of <unk> income , i recommend restoring priority to pricing and market policy , taking the view that progress in product quality , necessary as it is , is only the passport giving access to those markets .
several directions will therefore have to be opened up or reaffirmed so that the market can play its part without prices collapsing and taking incomes with them .
i will quote them : ‘ flexible , production-based regulation of supply ; the introduction of production-based safety nets ; community encouragement of sectoral policies for a better distribution of added value ; our imports should be subject to the same standards as those of the union ’ .
from this report , members will all understand that there is still a tremendous amount to be done if the cap is to achieve its objectives .
our european agricultural model was legitimate in its conception .
it must become so in reality again .
that is why i regret the commissioner ’s absence from this debate all the more .
– mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to start with warm thanks to mr garot for his own-initiative report on trends in agricultural incomes in the european union .
speaking personally , i want to thank him especially for his frank and constructive cooperation in the committee on agriculture and rural development .
the member states are currently engaged in implementing as part of their national policies the luxembourg conclusions on reform of the common agricultural policy .
our starting point is that , in accordance with the brussels conclusions , the agricultural budget was capped .
the funds available must from now on be shared out among farmers in the eu of 00 rather than only in the eu of 00 , and moreover , must in future be more <unk> applied than was previously the case , so that funds from the first pillar – direct payments , in other words – are to be moved to the second pillar , to rural development .
this is something that all of us in this house have always demanded .
mr garot ’s report represents an outstanding assessment of the situation in that it analyses , in the light of enlargement , the factors on which agricultural incomes are currently dependent .
the group of the european people ’s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats takes the view that there are fundamental objectives to be achieved by means of the common agricultural policy .
they are as follows : firstly , to guarantee a fair level of income for those who work in agriculture . secondly , by stabilising incomes , it must maintain agricultural activity throughout the whole area of the european union .
it is for that reason that we believe , firstly , that the retention of the level of public subsidies for agriculture is justified , in particular to reward the multifunctional services it renders to society and to ensure that farmers remain present in all regions , as is provided for in the first pillar .
secondly , we believe there is justification for the community budget guaranteeing employment , especially in less-favoured rural areas , and for farms to be rewarded for adaptation to society ’s new demands , which is what we understand by the second pillar .
in the hope of turning these principles into reality , we in the group of the european people ’s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats have tabled , in the committee on agriculture and rural development , a number of amendments , to which – as i mentioned at the start of my speech – we have been able to secure the rapporteur ’s agreement .
for example , our specific proposals include the introduction of a system of disaster payments , which is already the practice in other great agricultural nations .
we specifically demand that a large proportion of the funds available remain , insofar as possible , in the hands of farmers .
it necessarily follows that we are in favour of the norm laid down in the luxembourg conclusions – in other words , the single farm payment – being applied when they are implemented at national level .
our final demand is that no major distortions of competition within european agriculture should be allowed to result in the event of the exemption under article 00 being chosen .
let me conclude by saying that we have to bear in mind that competitiveness and multifunctionality must , again and again , be subjected to scrutiny and assessed , and that due regard must be paid to development .
without an adequate income , no farmer will be able to perform his tasks in producing food and in caring for the garden of eden that we still – thank heaven ! – have here in europe , in a professional manner and in line with good practice .
we must therefore take the funds available in the agriculture budget and apply them , in a europe of 00 member states , in such a way that the competitiveness of working farmers in the market is supported .
we must never lose sight of the need to guarantee young farmers a start and to offer them good prospects .
these , more than ever , are the challenges we must take up .
the common agricultural policy adopted in june 0000 opens up interesting ways of doing this .
– mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i congratulate mr garot on his excellent report ; much of what has already been said i do not need to repeat .
discussion of farmers ’ incomes is long overdue ; the fact is that they are far too low .
the various underlying causes i will illustrate by reference to the example of germany .
one of the most important is that farmers are still unable to command on the market the prices that they need for their products and which would be quite justified .
the causes of this state of affairs can be traced back to the fierce competition between the six or seven food concerns that dominate the market , a turf war fought out to the detriment of farmers .
these concerns see farmers as nothing more than suppliers of cheap raw materials .
i might add that the same is true of many dairies .
to that can be added the fact that consumers , that is , most people , do not know anything about this and , indeed to some extent , do not want to .
the fact is that high-quality food , for example that produced in accordance with high standards of protection for the environment and for animals , comes at a price ; it is not to be had for free .
even the , the german farmers ’ union , which represents the interests of most german farmers , has had its hand in this , for – in my opinion – it has for far too long not merely blocked or delayed important reforms , but has positively prevented some of them .
its unending lamentations , which have been its <unk> for decades , about how <unk> farmers have now virtually made the public deaf to farmers ’ legitimate demands and needs .
let me add that many farmers tell me these things at events once the ’s functionaries have gone .
the reforms adopted over the past year are thus all the more important to farmers ; they should have been adopted years ago .
the decoupling of payments from production was long overdue .
here , in this house , we have done our bit ; it is now for the member states to properly implement these conclusions and to do away once and for all with the unfair treatment of different types of farming , such as , for example , dairy cattle and arable farming . let me quote you some figures .
up to now , 00 % of the farms with 00 % of the land and 00 % of the jobs have been getting 00 % of the direct grants , and , let it be noted , relatively little was to be seen or heard of those who are now so loudly indignant about the injustice that is allegedly going to result from the agricultural reform .
we social democrats support compensatory payments for farmers because they have to be rewarded appropriately for the services that they perform in the general interest within a multifunctional system and which the prices paid do not cover .
this must , however , be done in accordance with transparent , open , and comprehensible rules .
none of us can evade the question of what high-quality foodstuffs are actually worth to us .
for the engine in our cars we buy only the best and most expensive petrol , but when it comes to the body , which is our own engine , without which we cannot exist and which is meant to work for at least 000 years without spluttering , most of us are completely indifferent to what we put into it .
all that matters is that there should be a lot of it and that it should be cheap .
that is not on .
even though this may be wishful thinking at present , we do believe that it would be for the best if farmers were to be able to have a good living from the prices paid for their produce .
that is what we social democrats are working for .
i thank you .
mr president , i wish to thank mr garot for a valuable contribution to the debate on farmers ’ incomes .
mr garot is a committed politician on agricultural matters . he is well informed and takes a positive view of agriculture .
i have to say that , as a swede , i am rather envious . we could have done with a few social democrats of that kind in the swedish government .
it would have been very useful for us .
allow me to address a number of points i think are important .
mr garot states that agriculture should be carried on throughout the whole area of the eu .
that is very important to remember , especially when the parts of the eu concerned are those such as i myself come from , that is to say sweden or finland .
he also addresses another very important matter , namely the difference between cost development and price development .
a discrepancy arises that can be resolved with the help of rationalisation , but not to an unlimited degree .
it must be ensured that this discrepancy does not become too large .
we have seen how it has increased in my own country following the latter ’s accession to the eu .
it is now far too large , and production is in decline .
we have defended the agricultural reform . that has been decided upon .
it is not , however , good for it to be implemented at different speeds in different countries .
this is important , something that is also pointed out in the report .
when the agricultural reform is implemented at different speeds , there is a danger of making further changes to competitiveness or of creating an uneven playing field in the different countries where competitiveness is concerned .
it is now a matter of extreme urgency to do as much as is humanly possible in terms of environmental aid and aid for rural development .
as mr garot says in his report , there is a danger of this being undermined if the member states are to cofinance it .
this is an area i am concerned about .
i must , however , address a number of aspects of this report that i do not think are as good . it is rather <unk> , if i may say so .
the desire is to keep as many people as possible in agriculture .
i do not believe that this is realistic in the long term .
i do not believe it is realistic to retain far-reaching market regulation or prices set by politicians , nor to have a regulated supply of the type we have involving quotas .
we must seek to reduce border protection in order to cope with world trade .
now that we are carrying out this disengagement , it would have been better if we could have done it completely from the beginning and , in fact , throughout the eu in the one go .
as a result of these considerations , i and many others in the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party will unfortunately abstain from voting .
we cannot vote in favour of this report but , in view of all the plus points i mentioned at the beginning , we cannot vote against it , either .
we shall no doubt abstain from voting in the final vote , because it is only a single vote .
– mr president , underlying the whole report is the fundamental idea that people in the european community – and in all its regions , widely divergent in their structure though they are – have a job and hence an entitlement to an income commensurate with what they produce .
if i am right in my understanding of what the rapporteur said , then it is only if that is the case that one can talk of there being such a thing as social european union .
the report rightly points out that yields vary widely across the european union , even though europe ’s climate and other natural conditions are favourable to almost all crops .
the principal causes of the changes in costs over recent years are well-known .
my expectation of future reforms is that the commission will take more account of their ability to influence the cost structure .
i also expect openings to be created for more investments , and i hope that a greater diversity of programmes will result in simplification and clarity of vision .
as in other reports , reference is made to the fact that direct payments to farmers , being factored in as sources of income , cannot simply be cut out without the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs , and i believe , with regret , that there are those who want that to happen .
more and more people in europe ’s rural areas are doing more than one job , and so every euro that is not spent on structural planning and development in rural areas – i am talking in terms of billions – is always associated with the loss of income and jobs .
this makes it important to assess whether the work and the way the european agricultural model is applied tend towards appropriate rewards for european farmers , and what is meant by that .
about this , the rapporteur is rather reticent , the reason being that there is a lack of data .
my expectation , though , is that , as the market organisation develops further , we will be able to answer the question of what an appropriate income for farmers actually is .
in germany , farmers ’ incomes have dropped dramatically , by 0.0 % and 00.0 % in the last two financial years .
that amounts to an overall economic crash .
this bleak state of affairs has come about for two reasons ; one is flooding and drought , but – as has already been said in this debate – it has far more to do with the price war in food retailing , in which farmers are generally on the losing side .
how are the location of production , and hence employment and income , affected by the decoupling of payments and their being linked to environmental requirements – an attempt at riding two horses , in giving the market a greater role in determining farmers ’ incomes while rewarding with public funds services that are no longer in demand ?
will it ensure extensive agricultural land use ?
far from it ; it is far more to be feared that it will lead to the onset of predatory competition and that we will be facing structural changes that will leave local areas worse off .
that is something i do not want .
– mr president , mr garot has produced a good report , and it is to his credit that he has brought the price of produce back to the centre of the debate .
decoupling has facilitated the removal of the twofold price distortions brought about by payments , which tended to keep prices down and thus gave customers the opportunity to get their hands on cheap raw materials , in that the linking of grants to production – which was itself unequally distributed – meant that between 00 % and 00 % of this state aid was claimed by between 00 % and 00 % of farms .
now , even though decoupling is in place – and it was the right step to take – it does not automatically follow that different power relations have come into being ; rather , what matters is that prices should be actively negotiated .
this is not just about the distributing chains , but also about the cooperatives , some of them managed by farmers , which pursue their price and market policies in decision-making bodies , and it is about better payments for raw materials – agricultural raw materials .
you have also made it clear that we now have to talk about modulation and about different ways of distributing these funds .
modulation must link the practice of some large and rationalised farming enterprises receiving from the state a premium amounting to eur 000 000 per worker , to the number of employees and also to the type of production .
from this , quality criteria must be developed , in order that state funds do not contribute to the accumulation of assets and give the wrong stimuli to production , but instead , enable the continuation of rural production methods in europe .
mr president , i join in congratulating mr garot on his report .
the recent hearing on farm income must surely have alerted all of us to the challenges facing eu farmers .
it is easy to understand their frustration as they see their purchasing power eroded and their general quality of life under attack on many fronts .
mr garot succeeds in his report in focusing our minds on the basics of the common agricultural policy and what it is all about .
we have a treaty basis for ensuring that farmers and their families are guaranteed a decent standard of living .
we also have an obligation to maintain the european model of agriculture , which is based on family farm units and keeping a vibrant rural community .
those who seek to undermine the common agricultural policy sometimes forget these basics .
they forget that there is a socio-economic dimension to farming and that it is not just a business like any other sector .
mr garot presents these facts very clearly .
it also hides the fact that during the same period income levels have been maintained largely by a fall of 00.0 % in the number of farms within the european union .
here , surely , lies one of the most serious challenges facing the continuity of european agriculture .
frequently farms have been able to revert to short-term measures such as foregoing necessary capital investment on farms .
there has also been huge growth in part-time farming and off-farm employment .
when we compare agricultural to industrial or service wages we can see that there is a continuing widening gap .
in conclusion , this report highlights important challenges that we legislators and policy-makers have to face up to .
it is now essential that agricultural policy should still be used to protect and improve the incomes of as many householders as possible within the european union and to guarantee a secure future for our farmers and their families .
– mr president , this report is a good initiative and i congratulate its author .
in fact , it brings us up to date on agricultural incomes just before the application of cap reform and the enlargement of the european union .
it will therefore serve us as a reference document in a few years ’ time , when , i hope , we shall be meeting together in this assembly again to consider the consequences of the reform for our farmers ’ incomes .
will the accession of ten new countries that are themselves highly agricultural and the alignment of european agricultural prices with world prices bring us a better future ?
i do not want to be a prophet of doom , but unfortunately i doubt it .
this report underlines some important facts , in particular the 0 % increase in european agricultural incomes over seven years , which hides many disparities between regions and sectors and is rooted in a degradation of the european agricultural model , as the rapporteur pointed out in his address .
in ten years , one quarter of europe ’s farmers have vanished , farms have become larger and production has intensified .
some french small farmers have such low incomes that the french government gives them access to the ‘ integration minimum income ’ , a system of social support reserved for the most deprived .
i come from the vosges , a rural not far from here .
between 0000 and 0000 , the number of farms there fell by 00 % and the number of dairy farms halved .
at the same time , farm areas increased 00 % and the number of cows per farm 00 % .
this concentration in agriculture is damaging to the european family agricultural model , as the parliamentary report very clearly shows .
decoupled aids are not a viable solution for the farmer .
according to the nantes <unk> study , in 0000 partial decoupling could result in as much as a 00 % drop in simulated income for an intensive dairy farmer because the decoupled aids will not compensate for the 00 % fall in the price of milk envisaged for 0000-0000 .
the drafting of this report gave an opportunity to consult a number of experts on the subject .
they all underlined this intrinsic paradox of the latest common agricultural policy reform . how indeed can we think of pushing up costs through multifunctionality while at the same time wanting agricultural prices to fall by bringing european prices into line with world prices ?
what solution is there for farmers trapped between rising production costs and falling prices .
no expert has been able to tell us that .
finally , the report explains a risk that is of particular concern to me , namely the eco-conditionality of aids for small farms , since their income is going to depend increasingly on aids , especially with decoupling .
a small farmer who failed to comply with one of a very large number of directives , including the <unk> directive , would have his aids , and therefore his income , cut off .
the incomes of farmers who are already fragile and who have little capacity to invest will be reduced .
this report puts its finger on the painful points of the common agricultural policy and its latest reform , and i can only welcome these facts being brought out into the open .
however , some parts of the report remain ambiguous and i cannot support them .
i cannot ask the member states , and i quote : ‘ to ensure that partial decoupling is actually applied ’ , because i have always opposed any form of decoupling , be it partial or total .
likewise , i am not in favour of , and i quote : ‘ ensuring a readjustment in favour of the second pillar ’ . the first pillar , which allows farmers to maintain a lucrative price for agricultural products , cannot be weakened in order to subsidise the second .
this parliamentary report has the merit of clearly presenting some important and sometimes painful realities of the common agricultural policy .
however , it includes an ambiguous support for key aspects of the cap reform , against which my group has spoken out , and that is why i will find it very difficult to support it .
– mr president – unfortunately i cannot add ‘ commissioner fischler ’ , as his seat is empty – ladies and gentlemen , the interest of this own-initiative report on trends in agricultural incomes in the european union lies more in the questions it raises than in the answers it seeks to give .
its starting point is beyond dispute .
we can use whatever fine words we want about the european agricultural model – multifunctional , kind to the environment and animal welfare , guaranteeing food safety , covering all our territories – but if the players are not there to implement it , that is farmers with enough income to do what they have to do , to live from their activities and attract the next generation , then the model will remain a utopia , a mirage , semantics , a lie .
the problem the report describes is indeed the one we are going to have to face in the years ahead .
if the average income of the community farmer – an abstract and therefore artificial statistical concept – has not already collapsed further despite the policy of systematically cutting prices , it has been at the price of very severe restructurings characterised by a dramatic reduction in the number of people working on farms and a very rapid increase in the concentration of farms together with the intensification of production .
but if we want to maintain the greatest number of farmers on all the territory of the member states in future , we will no longer be able to have this trilogy of disappearance , concentration and <unk> .
europe can no longer count on those types of adjustment to maintain its agriculture and develop its agricultural model .
neither can it count any longer on an increase in the agricultural budget to cover the extra costs that the new standards concerning multifunctionality demanded by society will entail .
quite the contrary , that budget is set to decline over the next ten years , with no prospect of a reversal of that trend in sight .
unlike the rapporteur , i believe that the june 0000 reform , which was inspired primarily by non-agricultural considerations – the desire to reach a general agreement in the wto and a desire to make budget savings – offers little prospect of a solution to the problem .
on the contrary , with decoupling it is more likely to accelerate concentration , intensification and land speculation , all trends which will have the effect of deterring young people from taking up farming and accelerating the <unk> of the sector .
if we want to avoid all this , we must redefine the concept of community preferences and we cannot put off doing so indefinitely .
when there are emergent countries with structural production conditions that utterly destroy the competitiveness of european agriculture , it is irresponsible to believe that only a policy of product quality or niche products will produce sufficient incomes to enable our farmers to continue occupying all our territories while providing society with the products and production conditions it wants .
– mr president , i should like to congratulate mr garot on his report .
he is one of the members of this house whom i hold in very high esteem .
however , if i read his report , my criticism in this case is that the socialist dimension is far too prevailing .
too much attention has been paid to the premiums while too little consideration has been given to the competitiveness of agriculture and horticulture .
it is generally the case that the european debate on incomes in agriculture is too much dominated by the question as to the level of premiums rather than what the market problems are .
starting with the premiums , the netherlands receives far too small a share of the european budget .
the netherlands accounts for 0 % of agricultural production in the european union , yet only receives 0.0 % of the agricultural budget and 0 % of the rural development budget .
this is out of all proportion .
of course , there is a reason for this .
the negotiations in berlin in 0000 were conducted by mr kok and mr zalm , neither of whom had any affinity with agriculture and horticulture .
that is not only the reason why the dutch countryside does not receive what it is entitled to ; it is also the real reason why the dutch net contribution to the european union is so high .
this excessive contribution is best remedied by giving the netherlands a substantially higher amount for agriculture and rural development .
there is also another point that is given too little consideration in the development of agricultural incomes , namely the position of the so-called free products .
the high european requirements in terms of environment , food safety and animal welfare have a knock-on effect on the cost price of – for example – meat , vegetables and potatoes , and put european agriculture at a worldwide disadvantage in terms of cost price .
that is the real reason underlying a number of crises , including the current one in pig farming .
my proposal is that in the case of new european legislative proposals affecting agriculture and horticulture , an income assessment should be done in order to check the true repercussions of this legislation on the workers in the fields .
mr president , i would like to join in the general praise for mr garot ’s wonderful report , which is as timely as it is necessary .
mr president , mr garot ’s rigorous analysis provides data confirming our concern at the danger posed by the reform of the cap if its negative impact on agricultural incomes is not neutralised .
i very much regret the seriously misguided and inconsistent way in which certain members , on the one hand , heap great praise on the report because it is good , but , on the other , say that they are not going to support it .
mr president , the fundamental objective of the cap is to guarantee a fair standard of living for the agricultural population .
europe needs multifunctional and viable agriculture , but this means that we must protect the european model , create a system of crisis management , guarantee employment and increase the resources dedicated to the second pillar .
all of this is proposed by mr garot in this wonderful report .
especially worthy of note are paragraph 0 – which the commission should apply – which points out that the costs of production are tending to increase while aid is tending to decrease ; paragraph 00 , which relates to guaranteeing employment ; and paragraphs 00 and 00 relating to the second pillar .
finally , mr president , the commission must take account of the view expressed by mr garot in paragraph 00 on cofinancing , as a demand which may hinder rural development , with a view to making this cofinancing requirement more flexible in the reform in the cap .
mr president , the rapporteur has made a really honourable attempt to embellish the common agricultural policy and its tragic consequences for farmers , but without managing to do anything more than repeat the set of arguments which the commission has also cited from time to time in order to justify its unjustifiable cap and its reforms .
arguments which have proven to be thoroughly disorientating and hypocritical in the past are being shamelessly used again today , precisely in order to continue the same anti-farming policy .
what social and multifunctional agriculture is the rapporteur talking about when , during the 0000-0000 reference period , the workforce fell by 00.0 % , with a commensurate reduction in agricultural households ?
behind it , this number conceals the abandonment of entire areas , especially in the mediterranean countries , it conceals the increase in unemployment and migration to the towns , with all the consequential problems and with incalculable consequences for environmental protection , for which the european commission would supposedly do anything .
he notes that agricultural incomes rose by an average of 0 % in the european union as a whole from 0000 to 0000 .
however , this increase is less than 0 % per annum , meaning that it is much less than the average increase in gdp in the european union over the same period and it concerns an economic sector in whose products the european union has a deficit .
in addition , no analysis is made so that we can see which holdings reported an increase in income , how many small and medium-sized farming households had a reduction and how many went bankrupt .
that is because the technique of averages in a differentiated social stratum such as agriculture is the best means of <unk> the waters , of hiding acute class divisions and of concealing important social problems .
so exactly what social and multifunctional agriculture are we talking about when the differential between agricultural incomes per worker is over 0 to 00 and when 00 % of large holdings take up 00 % of direct community aid ?
the unfair distribution in community subsidies at the expense of small - and medium-sized farmers has proven over time the capitalist nature of the cap , the objective of which is to concentrate land and production in a few capitalist farm holdings .
of course , wiping out small - and medium-sized farming and concentrating land will be completed by the new reform of the cap , which is even worse than all the previous reforms .
let me quote the typical example of the decoupling of subsidies from production , which the rapporteur welcomes , together with the conversion of intervention schemes to simple insurance networks and the exit of farmers from the market to become businessmen , to quote mr fischler .
reality is not consistent with the contradictory and prefabricated conclusions of the report .
it is so gloomy that it leaves no room even for <unk> or for further misleading farmers .
the common agricultural policy of extermination will be fought against by the small - and medium-sized farmers in my country and the european union , who are realising more and more every day that overturning it is the only way they will survive and …
mr president , i welcome the work of the rapporteur in bringing this own-initiative report together .
it strikes at the heart of the central question facing european agriculture at this crucial juncture , namely , whether the agricultural community can expect to make a fair living from its activities .
one of the report 's most illustrative points is that , while agricultural incomes rose by 0 % in the eu between 0000 and 0000 , this was at the expense of a 00 % decrease in the number of farms .
that means that small farms have been swallowed up by increasingly large farms and production that has become more intensive .
with consumers demanding more information on the means by which their food is produced , this trend is one that must be addressed .
large farms , selling bulk commodities , with pollution risks and herd health problems represent a future that we must work to avoid .
whilst the figures may continue to suggest that incomes are growing , they hide the impact of increasingly intensive farming methods .
this must be borne in mind each time the european parliament – and more importantly , the european commission – consider direct aid via the cap .
there is something seriously amiss with a system that continues to pump money into the pockets of some of europe 's largest and wealthiest landowners through lavish subsidies .
the duke of westminster – britain 's richest man – receives eur 0000 per day in agricultural subsidies , while small welsh farmers are struggling to get by with as little as eur 0000 per year .
– mr president , nature conservation , farms as family businesses , employment , safe food – these are all objectives to which we are trying to aspire with european agricultural policy .
in his report , mr garot was right to point out that , in the final analysis , all these fine words are not worth the paper they are written on if we do not guarantee a reasonable income for the farmer .
it is not easy to interpret the statistical income data .
mr garot concludes that over the past few years , agricultural incomes in the union have risen by 0 % .
i have checked with the researchers who supplied these figures whether this is correct .
they state that these figures do not take into consideration production levies , interest payable , rent and labour costs .
if one looks at the actual difference in the farmer 's wallet , then between 0000 and 0000 , agricultural incomes in the eu did not rise , but fell , by 0 % .
this resolution argues in favour of maintaining price and market policy and associated production control , with good reason .
in this respect , extending supply does not , by definition , benefit agricultural incomes .
if the milk quota is extended , the milk price continues to drop and the incomes of dairy farmers are put under pressure unnecessarily .
the wto summit in cancun has failed .
with it , a far-reaching liberalisation of trade in agricultural products has been put on hold for the time being .
agriculture is not like a bicycle shop where demand from the market can simply be accommodated .
protection remains necessary .
in this respect , developing countries are better served by preferential market access to the eu than unbridled free trade .
it is unfortunate that a socialist , of all people , who , by nature , believes in a society that can be moulded to one 's will , should accept the liberalisation of agriculture as a natural phenomenon .
the rapporteur fears that agricultural support from the eu is losing its legitimacy in the eyes of the wto .
i do not share this fear , because as in football , it is not only about technique , but also about strategy .
otherwise , the french would never be able to take a game off the dutch team !
i regret that in this resolution , mr garot is already working towards another reform : the reform of decoupled support to a form of rural policy .
however much i applaud rural policy , it cannot replace european agricultural policy .
mr garot is wrong to seize upon european agriculture 's multifunctionality as an excuse for a new form of structural policy , one that has to pump money into an area on the basis of acreage instead of production value .
if we want to sustain the family business and reject untrammelled economies of scale , our policy has to be in keeping with this .
this entails the capping of high company allowances and a systematic protection of small - and medium-size businesses .
this , at least , is something that will be of some use to the european farmer .
mr president , the agricultural sector of the european union faces many problems .
greek farmers in particular are anxious about their future .
they are anxious about whether to continue to farm their land or to join the queues of the unemployed in the towns .
however , we cannot hope for a strong greece unless we safeguard strong regions .
and strong regions mean strong farmers .
we must apply a policy which secures farmers a decent income so that they can be master of their own land ; so that they have employment , prospects , a future , a productive horizon for their children .
regions without farmers mean a country without a future .
guaranteeing agricultural incomes at decent levels is not just an economic issue .
it is , at the same time , a huge social and moral issue .
we therefore need to follow an organised agricultural policy which will consistently and constantly lead to the strengthening of the agricultural sector .
we need to give greek farmers the optimism which they lack today , the belief that their work has a future and that their future is close to their land , with prospects , with a serious income and with dignity .
– mr graefe zu baringdorf , do i take it that you are seeking the floor for a procedural motion ?
– mr president , we have had an important debate on agricultural policy , but without commissioner fischler .
his absence has been the subject of criticism , and it is also regrettable .
the commission is having a meeting on medium-term financial planning , and fairness requires that i , on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development , make it plain to the house that we think it important that commissioner fischler should be present at that meeting .
we do , though , regret that the two commitments have overlapped , it is something that we strenuously tried to avoid , but without success .
it is thus that we find ourselves in the unfortunate position of having to have this debate without commissioner fischler .
– thank you . your comment will be passed on .
the debate on the garot report will resume at 0 p.m. .
we will now begin the vote , which , as you know , will be interrupted by a formal sitting .
. – ladies and gentlemen , although i am sure you do not think this regulation is important , i propose to explain to you why it is ; it is intended to ensure that the member states forward reliable data on their financial transactions to eurostat every quarter .
this data is to include all forms of debt – in other words , not only all loans , but also general government debt .
reliable statistics such as these are meant , among other things , to help the european central bank to draw up its quarterly financial accounts for the eurozone .
as i made clear at first reading in october , this regulation is overdue , not least because these essential items of data , which are now to be forwarded on a quarterly basis , are of decisive importance to the stability and growth pact , on which is founded the stability of the euro – about which you have heard a certain amount said in recent months .
i had hoped that we could have spared ourselves a second reading , as we had obtained the italian presidency ’s agreement to some sensible amendments , which met with the overwhelming approval of this house at first reading .
the regulation could , then , have entered into force before the end of 0000 , but that was not to be , mainly because a number of member states discovered that they had not after all made sufficient preparations for the required data to be transferred so quickly .
that is in fact hard to comprehend , as one would have thought that the member states would have an interest in knowing the state of their finances every quarter .
nevertheless , we are willing to agree to this more flexible approach to forwarding in order to avoid the further delays that would result if we were to insist on a conciliation procedure .
that might well have suited those member states that have difficulty keeping to the stability pact and therefore have an interest in drawing a veil over the actual level of their public debt .
as we do not want to do these member states a favour , i propose that we adopt the common position .
thank you mrs lulling .
thanks to you , the european parliament is now well informed .
under rule 000a ( 0 ) of the rules of procedure , which you know by heart , you are entitled to two minutes .
– in view of the number of votes we still have to take , i think it reasonable to pause now that the initial votes have been taken .
the remaining votes will be taken at the end of the formal sitting .
( 0 )
. mr president , i have tabled amendment no 0 , which adds a new paragraph 0c , in the interests of achieving the widest possible consensus of a report that deserves support because it represents a new opening in our policy towards financial markets .
i wish to change a word that will give more flexibility to the report and make it acceptable to more colleagues .
i will read the amendment : ' calls upon the commission to undertake all necessary steps , including in particular a cost-benefit analysis of the effects on european capital markets , to assess the establishment of a competent european registration ' .
this word replaces ' authority ' .
the rest remains unchanged .
this change gives the flexibility desired by certain colleagues and i look forward to their support .
– very well , mr katiforis .
your proposal related therefore to amendment no 0 . firstly , we have two others to put to the vote .
when we arrive at amendment no 0 , i shall ask , in accordance with the procedure , if any members are opposed to your oral amendment being taken into account .
i see that mr gollnisch is <unk> to say something .
if it is not genuinely about a procedural motion , i shall switch off his microphone immediately .
– mr president , if referring to the nature of the rules whereby our assembly arranges to hear heads of state speak is not a procedural motion , then i do not know what is .
in any case , i shall be brief .
i think that , of the foreign heads of state received by our parliament , many – beginning with mr bouteflika – have not , to say the least , been the representatives of completely democratic regimes …
– mr gollnisch , i had warned you .
i do not see to which rule of procedure you are referring .
this is not a procedural motion ; it is a political remark , and you do not have the floor .
updating and harmonising social security systems are crucial issues for the member states and hence the need to support initiatives that will help them to achieve these aims .
the social protection committee , which is intended to promote cooperation on social security policies between the member states , the candidate countries and the commission is one such initiative and therefore won my vote .
the committee must monitor the social security situation in the member states and changes in this situation . it must present reports , specifically on situations of poverty and social inclusion – deliver opinions , establish contacts and cooperate with the relevant bodies in this field .
i would stress that greater priority must be given to parliament ’s role .
the committee should inform parliament in an efficient way so that parliament can follow up this issue and parliament ’s position must be taken into account in all the activities of the social protection committee .
lastly , i would emphasise that the gender balance must be respected in the composition of the committee delegations .
. this amendment on the social protection committee , which was established by council decision of 00 june 0000 , is of a basically procedural nature .
it was brought about by the entry into force of the treaty of nice , on 0 february 0000 , in particular by the new legal basis set out in article 000 thereof , with the commission and parliament having taken the opportunity to make some changes to the approach they had adopted previously .
one of the proposals that the ep has adopted and which i tabled in the committee of employment and social affairs seeks to ensure that the joint report on social protection pays ‘ particular attention to poverty issues and to progress in social inclusion within the eu member states and in the accession countries ’ .
proposals seeking to incorporate the gender dimension horizontally into the committee ’s duties , and to report on problems specifically affecting women were also adopted , particularly on the feminisation of poverty and the changes in family models .
i therefore believe it is important to establish indicators broken down by gender and to focus on the individual rather than on the household .
. the treaty of nice provides for establishing a social protection committee , with consultative status , to promote cooperation in the field of social protection policies between member states and between these and the commission .
a social protection committee , with a similar status and aims , was established by council decision of 00 june 0000 , and has been operational since that date .
the purpose of this report is therefore essentially procedural : to establish the committee in accordance with the new legal basis .
nevertheless , we must welcome the fact that this council also has the tasks of monitoring the social situation , of promoting the exchange of good practice and of establishing appropriate contacts with management and labour .
equally to be welcomed is the call for an annual report to be drawn up on social protection and for this to be presented to the council and to parliament .
in this regard , we believe that an effective process of informing parliament must be established to enable it regularly to monitor social protection issues , in particular those related to poverty .
for these reasons , the report won my vote .
. as you know , the treaty of nice provides for establishing a social protection committee , with consultative status , to promote cooperation in the field of social protection policies between member states and between these and the commission .

the purpose of this report is therefore essentially procedural : to establish the council in accordance with the new legal basis .
nevertheless , we must welcome the fact that this council also has the tasks of monitoring the social situation .
it will promote the exchange of good practice and establish appropriate contacts with management and labour .
it will also aim for a more structured engagement with ngos and to pay particular attention to poverty-related issues .
i welcome the rapporteur ’s proposal to call for a joint annual report to be drawn up and presented to the council and the european parliament .
this report must include a specific chapter containing parliament ’s views on social protection issues .
an effective process of information shall be established to permit the european parliament to follow matters up on a regular basis , and the candidate countries must be informed and consulted .
i voted in favour , of course .
. in recent decades , various environmental disasters have taken place , including the sinking of the , off the coast of galicia , which has had terrible consequences as regards maritime pollution .
there is a clear need for international cooperation , because no state is able to combat the consequences of a major maritime pollution accident on its own , and the aim of this cooperation must be to prevent and effectively combat such pollution .
i must , therefore , support the community ’s conclusion of this protocol on cooperation concerning combating pollution in the mediterranean sea , one of the protocols appended to the barcelona convention ( a <unk> initiative , to which 00 mediterranean countries have signed up ) .
given its lengthy coastline , portugal would always have to support any initiative that promotes international cooperation with the aim of preventing and combating maritime pollution .
there is no problem as regards the initiative ’s compatibility with community legislation , because this is even more stringent than the protocol , since the community has stepped up and strengthened its action in the field of preventing and combating maritime pollution .
one example of this is the set of initiatives that we adopted here during the last part-session .
– i voted in favour of the report , for it is imperative to conduct a determined and coordinated battle against all forms of pollution in the mediterranean .
every day , the mediterranean is the target of maritime hooligans who see it as a dustbin .
let us not forget that more than six million tons of <unk> waste is deliberately discharged into the sea every year .
moreover , i support the european measures advanced in the field of maritime safety following the loss of the .
efforts must , however , continue unabated in order to prevent new disasters from occurring , and people , fauna and flora from paying the price .
this fight against pollution must be accompanied by a genuine preventive policy from further up the line .
state port control and cooperation between the maritime police of different coastal states need to be strengthened .
the fight against those who pollute the sea must be more effective and be accompanied by heavy penalties , with all parties involved in the goods transportation chain having to assume their share of responsibility .
to conclude , i would invite the member states that have still not ratified this protocol to do so as soon as possible .
. i welcome the measures intended to achieve closer international cooperation in combating maritime pollution .
the terrible accidents that have taken place in recent decades have shown that no state on its own is able to combat the consequences of a major maritime pollution accident .
portugal , like the other member states of the european union that are not part of the mediterranean region , is not party to this regional convention or to any of the eight additional protocols .
in accordance with article 00 of the barcelona convention , a country must be party to the convention in order to sign up to any of the protocols .
these regional initiatives include the united nations strategy to implement the montego bay convention ( the united nations convention on the law of the sea ) and are mirrored by the lisbon agreement to protect the northeast atlantic .
nevertheless , as everyone knows , the lisbon agreement has not entered into force because it has not been ratified by spain and morocco , as a result of the dispute over the delimitation of borders between these two countries .
. parliament was asked to deliver an opinion on control measures applicable under the convention on future multilateral cooperation in the north-east atlantic fisheries , ensuring a comprehensive monitoring and inspection scheme that will enable the resources in the area covered by this international convention to be exploited on a sustainable basis .
with the stevenson report now before us , parliament urges the commission to be more consistent in managing sustainable fisheries , and calls for a clarification of community competences in the field of monitoring and inspection .
the report also calls for more information to be provided on the costs of monitoring and inspection services operating in the member states .
the convention on future multilateral cooperation in north-east atlantic fisheries ( neafc ) provides for a mechanism to ensure the monitoring and inspection of fishing grounds .
the european union chose to divide this task between the commission and the member states .
in practice , however , this situation has led to problems in implementation , and to some constraints , which are to be expected when responsibilities are divided .
without completely rejecting the system chosen by the eu , parliament must exert pressure to ensure a greater clarification of the competences of each party , the commission on the one hand and the member states on the other .
one such clarification might involve creating a community inspection agency .
– mrs stihler , as this is a report that falls under rule 000 ( b ) of the rules of procedure , the explanations of vote can in theory only be given in writing .
having , however , made the mistake of giving the floor to mr fatuzzo , who was in the same position as yourself , i am happy to give it to you .
mr president , with regard to the kindermann report , many of my constituents are concerned about the unnecessary killing of dolphins and porpoises in europe 's seas .
it is time for us to act swiftly .
that is why the kindermann report is so important .
i am certain that these measures will make a real difference : a general restriction on the length of driftnets in the baltic sea from 0 july 0000 , a further reduction in driftnet fishing by 0 january 0000 ; the compulsory use of acoustic deterrent devices and the introduction of a comprehensive system for monitoring the levels of dolphins and porpoises .
these policies show why it is important to have a common fisheries policy and if these measures become part of that policy , we will then have the full force of the law across the 00 member states .
that shows just how important the eu and its enlargement into eastern europe are for all of us concerned about the environment .
. the aim of this regulation is to reduce the incidental catching of cetaceans such as dolphins and porpoises in fishing nets , which is threatening the conservation of this species .
there are insufficient data to enable a precise calculation to be made of the number of by-catches of cetaceans in fishing nets and of the impact of these catches on populations .
there are , however , scientific papers proving that the majority of the fishing nets most commonly used in europe are responsible for some cetacean by-catches .
by establishing new measures designed to combat cetacean by-catches , this proposal for a regulation not only provides a response to the scientific papers but also makes a significant contribution to eradicating catches of cetaceans whose conservation would otherwise be threatened .
hence my vote in favour .
. i support this proposal for a regulation , which seeks to establish measures to combat the incidental catch of cetaceans such as dolphins and porpoises , during fishing activities , with the corresponding amendment to regulation ( ec ) 00/00 .
in fact , although the conservation of cetaceans is subject to protection under the ' habitats ' directive , the measures contained therein have not proven sufficient to guarantee an appropriate level of protection .
because the most serious problems appear to be caused by <unk> and drift nets , i believe it would be appropriate to lay down rules and limits on the use of these fishing techniques , and i therefore endorse the proposals tabled to this end .
nevertheless , and despite the findings of some existing scientific papers , i regret the fact that there are no more precise data that would enable a precise calculation to be made of the number of cetacean by-catches , and the european union must strive to remedy this lack of information as a matter of urgency .
we must , in fact , obtain reliable data on population units and on the incidental catches of cetaceans in various fishing grounds and at a later date , draw more wide-ranging conservation measures .
. i voted in favour of this commission proposal , the aim of which is to protect deep-water coral reefs from the effects of trawling in an area north west of scotland .
incorporating environmental requirements into the common fisheries policy also involves adopting measures designed to minimise the impact of fishing on marine ecosystems .
recent scientific reports have shown that some deep-sea habitats are in need of protection against mechanical erosion caused by fishing gear .
i therefore support the commission ’s ban on using these drift-nets in the darwin mounds .
adopting this measure will bring substantial environmental benefits , without having a significant impact on the fisheries sector , because fishermen will be able to continue using drift-nets outside the fishing zone containing the darwin mounds , or , within the protected zone , using towed nets that do not come into contact with the seabed .
the attwooll report on the protection of the darwin ’s mounds coral reefs from the effects of trawling has ceased to be so discriminatory and disproportionate in three crucial areas , thanks to the amendments that i tabled with the committee on fisheries and that have been adopted .
the commission wanted to ban recourse to deep-sea trawlers well beyond the area of distribution of the darwin ’s mounds .
the text now refers to the 0000 advisory committee on ecosystems ( ace ) report in order to define this area which , in fact , covers two distinct zones ten times less extensive than that defined by the commission .
deep-sea trawlers were accused of systematically destroying the corals .
it is now laid down that the measures provided for must relate exclusively – and avoiding any combination – to ‘ <unk> likely to cause real damage ’ .
finally , there is a demand for the interested parties and the regional advisory <unk> by fishing professionals to participate in the decision-making process .
the issue of the legal and economic uncertainty involved in the application of the habitats directive to european waters arises again , however , in connection with the commission ’s new bans on trawling in various sectors around the azores , madeira and the canary islands .
in the vision that i had , mr president , mr pannella was condemned to go on strike about a hunger strike , that is to say he was condemned to eat , to eat and get fatter and fatter .
then mr pannella said to me : ‘ please wake up mr fatuzzo , for you it is a dream , you were dreaming , but for me it is a nightmare ! ’
i therefore had to vote in favour of the report so as to protect poor mr pannella .
the outermost regions ( ors ) have specific structural and socio-economic conditions , which can result in permanent economic handicaps , including economic dependence on a few products and limited access to markets .
their economic activities are based chiefly on tourism , agriculture and fisheries , which is the case of the autonomous region of the azores and of madeira .
this own-initiative report , which i believe is broadly to be welcomed , is , therefore , important .
i agree with the need to ensure that article 000 ( 0 ) of the ec treaty constitutes the legal basis for all measures relating to the ors , including the fisheries sector . i also agree on the importance of the compensation scheme for the additional costs incurred in the marketing of certain fishery products and with increasing the budget of the posei programmes .
aid must also be maintained for renewing and modernising the local fleet , for increasing the eligibility of new species and for fishermen ’s active participation in the common fisheries policy .
the most pressing requirement for maintaining the fisheries sector in the ors , however , concerns the management of fishery resources , ensuring that only local fleets can fish in their exclusive economic zone , as the rapporteur advocates , to some extent , in paragraph 00 .
we must obtain detailed information on the state of fish resources in the ors , particularly of black <unk> .
. this report is based on the premise that the common fisheries policy ( cfp ) does not pay due attention to the specific interests of the outermost regions .
the rapporteur rightly believes that there is , in many ways , a conflict between the cfp on the one hand , which was planned with the interests of continental europe in mind and which applies to the outermost regions because of their status as an integral part of the community , and , on the other , the specific needs of the outermost regions which came into being as a result of their specific geographical , economic and social characteristics .
it should be added that the reform of the cfp has also failed to take due account of the needs of the regions in question .
in this context , we must establish a number of priorities reflected in various support measures , which warrant our attention .
first of all , increasing the eligibility of new species of fish from the outermost regions and maintaining aid for the construction of new vessels after 0000 .
next , increasing , as a matter of urgency , scientific research into fishery resources and finally creating fishing zones reserved exclusively for local fishermen .
i have voted in favour in order to support this consistent policy , which seeks to meet the needs of the outermost regions .
. i agree with this own-initiative report that raises the issue of the impact of the common fisheries policy ( cfp ) on the eu ’s outermost regions .
as the rapporteur rightly points out , supported by article 000 ( 0 ) tec , due to factors such as climate , topography , geographical location , small size , remoteness and economic dependence on a small number of products , the outermost regions have very specific structural , social and economic conditions .
i therefore share the rapporteur ’s opinion emphasising that adapting the cfp to the needs of these outermost regions must be done systematically and that defining a coherent and structured policy in this field is much-needed .
financial aid must be granted to those regions as a means of compensating for the additional costs incurred in marketing their fishery products and the funds that are provided should be better used .
i also greatly welcome the idea of establishing a fishing observatory in each outermost region , both to supervise fishing activities and to ensure better protection of fish resources and the environment .
mr president , we are talking about the acp-eu joint parliamentary assembly , one of the members of which is , as you know , the bahamas .
in 0000 i found myself in nassau , the capital of the bahamas ; paradise island , a fairy tale place for tourists to the bahamas .
we have of course voted against the report on this so-called acp ( <unk> ) – eu ‘ joint ’ parliamentary assembly . this is just a <unk> front for unequal relations and , in fact , for the plundering of these regions of the developing world by the european imperialist powers .
. like the rapporteur , i welcome the adoption and the implementation by the joint parliamentary assembly ( jpa ) of its amended rules of procedure , intended to streamline its activities .
particularly significant is the setting-up of three standing committees , which could help the assembly to become a genuine parliamentary assembly .
i believe the attention the jpa has paid to the rights of children and in particular to child soldiers , is to be lauded , as is the positive influence that its report had on this matter in the council , which resulted in strategic guidelines being adopted on the unacceptable use of children in armed conflicts .
i must , however , express my frustration at the jpa ’s inability to exert any positive influence over the situation in zimbabwe .
the jpa must strive to be more effective and efficient in preventing conflicts , become more actively involved in monitoring electoral and democratisation processes and promote the involvement of civil society in the work of the joint assembly and its standing committees , particularly when the jpa meets in acp countries .
despite my reservations arising from the conviction that the jpa could be more ambitious in these fields , i share the rapporteur ’s view that these developments are broadly to be welcomed .
i am therefore voting in favour .
yesterday , mr president , i closed my eyes for a moment to think about how i should explain my vote in favour of the bowis report on disease prevention and control .
with my eyes closed , i saw that mr bowis , in the next legislative period , had become eu commissioner for health and , with his usual commitment and professional ability , had succeeded in obtaining a huge financial and organisational undertaking to prevent a good many diseases for eu citizens , thus reducing health expenditure across europe , as well as disability pensions , without needing to reduce the budget for pensions and so harm pensioners .
this is why – with the hope that this really happens – i voted in favour of his report .
we moderates believe it is one of the european union ’s tasks to prevent the outbreak of serious infectious diseases and , when they do occur , to coordinate the response .
with freedom of movement within the eu and rapid ways of transmitting infections across its borders , a european centre could quickly take action to reduce and limit the effects and spread of outbreaks of disease .
we think it inappropriate to extend the centre ’s competence to include general public health issues .
we believe that the commission ’s proposals on important points are better than the european parliament ’s proposals , which is why we choose to support the commission ’s proposals .
. i very much support the report by the rapporteur which sets out the need to set up a european centre for disease prevention and control within the territories of the eu .
this centre will be funded from the eu budget and will come into existence next year .
as we are aware there is an eu communicable diseases network which has been in existence since 0000 .
it has acted as a channel for occasional cooperation between member states when they take measures against epidemics and other health risks .
an example of this would be the cooperation that was put in place for the different member states of the eu concerning the fight against sars last year .
however , several studies have revealed the long-term limitations of this arrangement .
we are aware that diseases such as aids , malaria and meningitis have no frontiers .
they spread with increasing ease around the world as a result of population movements and the expansion of trade .
the only concerted action by countries inside and outside the european union can hope to check these dangers effectively .
the aim of the new centre is to overcome the problems of the present arrangements and to develop and implement projects more coherently across the territories of what will be the 00 member states of the eu .
. i congratulate mr bowis on his excellent report on the proposal for a parliament and council regulation establishing a european centre for disease prevention and control , which has my support , especially as it is designed to improve communication , coordination and cooperation with the dedicated surveillance networks .
establishing a european centre for disease prevention and control will enable the eu to draw up a long-term plan for public health , to respond quickly to epidemics and to react effectively to any potential outbreak or other incident , without teams in different member states duplicating work .
. i believe that communicable diseases constitute an extremely serious threat to the health of citizens and therefore support the commission proposal to increase the means to effectively control such diseases , specifically by creating a european centre for disease prevention and control , which would bring together <unk> , public health experts , <unk> , logistics specialists and doctors .
the european union must strive to improve cooperation and coordination between member states in monitoring diseases .
the case of the atypical pneumonia ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) virus demonstrated the need for this .
it is thus crucial to create synergies between national disease control centres , ensuring epidemiological surveillance , creating laboratory networks , issuing scientific advice and having a body that can provide , at european level , an early warning and response system , also providing the necessary technical assistance and information on threats to health and preparing for health emergencies .
i agree with the suggestion that this centre must have a contingency budget to allow it to address unforeseeable situations .
this centre must be created around the community communicable diseases network that comprises designated national bodies responsible for communicable diseases within member states .
i voted in favour .
mr president , one of the reasons why we abstained in the vote on this motion for a resolution was because we did not find the slightest mention in it of the grave discrimination contained in the slovenian legislation on compensation – legislation that penalises refugees and their children for the terrible events that took place in the post-war period in these countries .
today , 00 february , is the second time that a day of remembrance has been celebrated in our country .
it is another holocaust that calls to mind the tragedies of totalitarianism of the last century .
and :
- the resolution criticises the commission on human rights for becoming highly politicised , obviously implying that the refusal by the majority of its members to satisfy the demands of the εu and the usa to condemn states and precisely serving their ideological and political expediencies ( cuba , china , north korea , vietnam , belarus etc. ) ;
- it avoids firing on the usa , where executions and blatant violations of human rights are a daily occurrence ;
- it proposes a ' fair ' trial for saddam hussein , while not only does it not propose a trial for bush , blair and their accomplices , it also proclaims them as guarantors of justice ;
