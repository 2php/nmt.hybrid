- human rights are again being ' exploited ' to pave the way for the cfsp , in other words military intervention .
. the question of human rights is one to which we could never be indifferent , yet this does not give us the right to give lessons on human rights .
it does , however , give us sufficient moral authority to refuse to accept other people ’s criteria for determining whether behaviour in the area of human rights is good or bad .
our abstention , far from being tantamount to indifference , is intended to show how important the question of human rights is to us and how we do not accept the approval of resolutions that are based on market ideology and related concepts , in which certain countries are mentioned and certain others not , in which there appear to be favourite sons and black sheep ... whereas there are no prodigal sons – perish the thought ! – in the field of competitiveness and productivity .
we similarly refuse to accept the smokescreen of compensation , in which the inclusion of some makes up for mere reference to others .
this explains our vote .
. the british conservative delegation strongly supports genuine human rights and the need for the un commission on human rights to take a robust position to overcome abuses in many parts of the world .
we therefore welcomed many aspects of the resolution , not least the concern expressed at the lack of action over zimbabwe .
however , we do not support the one-sided statement regarding the situation in the middle east which makes no mention of the appalling terrorism against israelis ; the unrealistic and broadly unsympathetic attitude to strong counter-terrorist measures ; or indeed the unquestioning approval of the rome statute of the international criminal court .
we therefore abstained on this resolution .
mr president , mr katiforis presents a report on the role and methods of rating agencies .
also in this case , when i closed my eyes , i saw mr katiforis who was running and running and was breathless . ‘ where are you running ? ’
i asked him . he said ‘ i am running so that i arrive to present my report before the collapse of parmalat in italy .
fatuzzo , you know mr mennea . tell him to get the rating report because he will certainly run faster than me , being a moscow olympic runner , and he will , therefore , get to present it and get it adopted before parmalat collapses ’ .
i am sorry to say that this was a dream that has not been realised : mr katiforis did not manage to get to present his report and have it adopted before the sad event of the parmalat bond collapse .
. recent financial scandals , such as enron and parmalat , are further evidence of the consequences of liberalising capital markets and the role of the rating agencies that gave the creditworthiness of these giant transnationals a clean bill of health , even though they did not disclose any information on their activities .
this was only allowed to happen because the rating agencies are a product of the private sector , a self-regulating product of the market that creates mechanisms to assess the creditworthiness of entities that finance themselves by collecting money from third parties , such as companies that float on the stock market and even states , in terms of issuing public debt .
rating agencies wield great power in the financial market , since rating is a legal condition of eligibility for investment portfolios .
additionally , the ratings ‘ market ’ is highly concentrated and the biggest agencies , two of which have their headquarters in the usa – one gave parmalat a positive rating – operate an oligarchy .
as a self-regulating instrument of regulation , the rating agencies serve to extend the liberalisation of the capital markets .
in order to make them an essential regulating body , they would have to be regulated by public bodies within the framework of national legislation and jurisprudence .
the report manages to ask questions and make diagnoses , but does not prescribe any medicine , which only serves to encourage these self-regulating instruments .
the question is more political than technical , and , politically speaking , the <unk> justifies our vote against .
– the rapporteur acknowledges that the privatisation of state-owned enterprises and of public services in poor countries – privatisation desired and imposed by big western investors and by the states that defend their interests – has helped increase poverty in the developing countries .
now that the european commission , which is among the guarantors of the interests of big european investors , seems to be advocating more diversified forms of privatisation in these poor countries , to their disadvantage , the rapporteur openly backs its recommendations .
well , we , on the other hand , do not .
we are , on principle , opposed to the open or creeping privatisation of public services , for it leads , always and everywhere , to a deterioration in the populations ’ living conditions .
in poor countries , this drastic impairment of peoples ’ conditions of life , and even of survival , is all the more appalling in that , as the rapporteur acknowledges , it is aimed at depriving what are already some of the most destitute peoples on the planet of the very little that they have , a process that is to the sole benefit of the western multinationals which , for their part , make more profit than they can cope with .
we have therefore voted against this report .
. – to economists , major profit-making international businesses , based in europe , america or japan , are often the benchmark for the developing countries , which would automatically prosper if those businesses were given the freedom to take over loss-making activities and export raw materials .
this assumption is short-sighted .
for centuries , the economy in those countries was controlled by the north , as a result of which they were forced to produce cheap products for the market of rich countries , to the detriment of their domestic economy and the provision of services to their own people .
to a large extent , following the removal of colonial government , they have themselves had to develop and extend provision in the fields of education , health care , public transport , house building , postal services , electricity , drinking water , telephone and sewage .
generally high development costs and low profit expectations have meant those sectors did not initially appeal to foreign private companies .
moreover , we saw that , in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , the early development of industry in japan was possible only thanks to state-owned companies that were privatised only after they had become profitable .
that is why it was useful that the committee on development and cooperation not only considered privatisation and full liberalisation but also the provision of services , poverty reduction , small businesses , cooperatives and a sustainable role for government initiatives .
it is lamentable that today ’s plenary has seen the christian democrats standing in the way of a majority for these instruments against poverty and underdevelopment .
. the rapporteur ’s endeavours in this apparent ‘ mission impossible ’ to give words their real meanings is worthy of praise .
the term ‘ cooperation ’m <unk> supporting the development of companies in third countries , as suggested in the title of the first communication that laid the basis for the report ; it also means reforming state-owned companies , which are the basis of public services in these countries , and the need to assess all possible solutions , as suggested in the title of the second .
such support is , however , <unk> by the predominant concept of companies that can only be regulated by the market , which has adopted the predominant strategy of structural adjustments , the predominant solution to which is to dismantle and privatise public services .
the rapporteur questioned ideological concepts and raised questions from a perspective that was not strictly commercial .
it is significant that he referred to the water supply and drainage , to education and to health services , which , in his opinion , should fall within the competences of the state and local authorities .
for local investors and smus , in the case of privatisation , to proceed as a matter of priority with the proposal that each <unk> should commit as a minimum investment 0.0 % of its gross turnover or 0 % of its net profit into new investments , as offset projects in these countries each year , in the context in which we live , is verging on provocation .
this is how this report was greeted by political forces that felt threatened by the presence of a rapporteur tabling alternatives to improve what had appeared incurable .
all the christian democratic proposals by the group of the european people ’s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats having been , in principle , adopted in plenary , thereby considerably improving the content of the report , i have voted in favour of the latter in the final vote .
the fight against poverty is the main objective of eu development policy .
history shows that state monopolies have often led to economic inefficiency , mismanagement , corruption and injustice in developing countries .
particularly in the case of services for the benefit of everyone , such as the supply of water and energy , together with education and health , the state sector has failed in the majority of these countries .
reforms in this sector can therefore contribute to improvements and growth .
through a number of amendments by ourselves in the ppe-de group , this is clearly shown by the report .
the report is therefore in line with the commission ’s assessment that the fight against poverty can only seriously be taken up through the objective consideration of all the alternatives for reform with a view to increasing economic growth and countering corruption .
monopoly situations , be they public or private , must be replaced by competition and diversity with a view to increased fairness and better economic management .
clear legal framework regulations must stand as guarantees of the right to services for the benefit of all .
small enterprises can operate as important engines of growth in the developing countries and should therefore be supported financially and through technical aid .
. delays have occurred in transposing this directive into national law in some member states , which shows the problems that its implementation has generated , particularly in industry .
this has led the commission to embark upon a wide-ranging consultation process with all those concerned .
we will not know , therefore , about the actual transposition of the directive until member states have submitted their national reports .
although the directive has been in force since october 0000 , in new installations and existing installations where the operator intends to carry out significant changes , a transitional period has been granted until october 0000 , which requires special support to be granted to industrial smes and to farmers .
the integrated prevention and control of pollution , which is the aim of this directive , can be achieved with a permit system for installations , which we welcome .
different circumstances must , however , be taken into account and the most contentious areas of the directive must be clarified , in order that we find acceptable solutions .
. i voted in favour of this resolution .
ever since the gothenburg summit the eu has been proposing ‘ sustainable development ’ , which is the only guarantee of human development that deems respect for the environment as an essential prerequisite for rapid progress .
i therefore consider it to be extremely important that we proceed responsibly – as in the question before us today – towards implementing and transposing directives that lay down this intention in law .
concepts such as ‘ cross-compliance ’ in the technical conditions of operating licences , sharing best practices and defining best available techniques ( bats ) , are just some of the ways in which we can ensure the integrated prevention and reduction of pollution resulting from a wide range of industrial and agricultural activities , and in which we can reach a higher level of environmental protection .
within the framework of the 0000 directive under consideration , a system of permits for new installations is established , which forces operators to adopt pollution prevention measures .
it also urges all installations to comply with the same rules from 0000 onwards .
i agree with the rapporteur when she stresses the importance of forcing member states to present their plans for assessing transposition ( also by 0000 ) as soon as possible .
for this purpose , a ‘ guidance document ’ clarifying the definition of ‘ installation ’ and other key terms would be most helpful …
the ices ( international council for the exploration of the sea ) operates today as an important independent organisation , based on national research institutions .
there is therefore no reason for the eu to seek membership and appoint people to work in the ices .
firstly , it would place a question mark over both the ices ’s and the commission ’s independence , since the commission is the main user of the ices ’s results .
secondly , there is a limited number of qualified researchers .
if the commission is to appoint researchers to this task , it will lead to a drain on the national institutions , for the simple reason that the commission pays better .
the june movement ’s three members of the european parliament , ulla sandbæk , jens-peter bonde and bent <unk> andersen , chose to vote against the report , a decision for which the following explanation of vote was given .
in principle , the june movement believes that all attempts by the eu to dominate the ices should be voted down .
this ought to be a national concern .
the june movement believes it would be better if the eu were to call upon the nation states to increase their scientific capacity in relation to the ices and , if need be , to coordinate research efforts in the area .
. in order to ensure the sustainability of fisheries resources , it is important that we are provided with detailed information and credible scientific opinions regarding the current state and ongoing development of these resources .
the overriding concern is reliability of information , which has often been called into question , thereby creating unwanted tension between investigators , scientists and fishermen .
there are therefore two crucial issues :
- the first entails fishermen taking an active role in the management of fishing effort and participating in the evaluation of studies into resources in conjunction with investigators and scientists .
fishermen have the most to gain from the sustainability of resources and from stock recovery measures .
it is therefore important that we create suitable bodies that enable effective communication between all those concerned ;
- the second entails a thorough evaluation of the socio-economic impact of stock recovery measures or measures aimed at reducing the fishing effort .
the implementation of these measures , which is sometimes voluntary on the part of the fishermen , as happens in portugal in the case of sardines , requires compensation at public , national and community level .
it is also necessary to increase eu funding in research in the fisheries sector and to create the material and human conditions required to improve scientific advice .
. scientific research has become an essential instrument in implementing the common fisheries policy and is crucial to the sustainable management of resources .
the limits placed on fishing in the eu have had devastating socio-economic consequences .
portugal has been particularly hard hit by such measures , especially in the conversion of activities and in the destruction of large parts of the national fishing fleet .
i see the consequences of fisheries management measures every day in the ports and fish markets of my region and i am furious that the commission continues to pursue the same policy , without having any evaluation carried out into the socio-economic impact of implementing these measures .
it is therefore important that these special arrangements , given their irreversibility , are duly justified in thorough scientific reports containing highly credible information on the development of resources .
given the lack of objective information , current scientific reports give rise to conflicting interpretations on the part of member states , thereby counteracting the effects of measures to protect fisheries resources .
i should like to take this opportunity to welcome the work of the rapporteur .
i share his concern about the lack of scientific advice on fishing , and about the scarcity of financial and human resources .
i also endorse the need to strengthen the ties between science and industry , thus giving the final results greater practicability .
. the report drawn up by mr lage addresses the important question of the credibility of scientific opinions used in fisheries management , given the frequent differences of opinion between scientists and fishermen regarding the current state of fisheries resources .
eu measures based on scientific advice can have a devastating impact on fishing communities .
it is in this light that we see the importance of this issue and the need to improve the quality of this advice .
mr lage ’s warning therefore gives the community the opportunity to base the common fisheries policy on more accurate , more timely advice , thereby leading to a stronger scientific basis than has thus far been detected .
it is unacceptable that we continue to see the ‘ commission ’s apparent unwillingness ’ , as mr lage puts it , to have regard to all the scientific advice available .
this only serves to increase suspicion of bias in their decisions , which tend to overlook fishing communities that are already completely unprotected .
my vote in favour of this report is , therefore , also an expression of solidarity with portuguese fishermen , who have been so severely affected by the commission ’s – and in particular commissioner fischler ’s – fisheries policy .
– the lage report rightly emphasises that the management measures adopted by the european union are too often based upon faulty and unreliable scientific diagnoses .
the socio-economic consequences of management measures adopted on such a flimsy basis are considerable : it is the very survival of entire fisheries and , indeed , entire industries that is at stake .
the scientific effort must therefore be increased and relate both to the biology of marine environments and to the selection of fishing gear , as well as to the socio-economic consequences of the measures for managing the resource .
the current imbalance in the cfp , which does not take overall account of the joint objectives of conserving the resource and ensuring the continuity of fisheries , must definitely be corrected .
to this end , the future regional advisory councils will have to play an absolutely key role in formulating requests for scientific advice .
they will have to request a range of management options , accompanied by estimates of their biological and socio-economic consequences .
such a development should permit an approach that is no longer brutal and irreversible but gradual , progressive , flexible and continuously adaptable .
i am pleased that it has been possible to adopt the amendments i had tabled along those lines .
that concludes the voting .
( 0 )
we shall now continue the item which was interrupted , which is the debate on the report ( a0-0000 / 0000 ) by mr garot , on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development , on the development of agricultural incomes in the european union ( 0000/0000 ( ini ) ) .
mr president , i should like to begin by saying how appalled i am that commissioner fischler is not here .
this simply defies belief , given the importance of the debate .
farmers have a right to decent incomes .
the guarantee of profitable producer prices must , therefore , be the guiding premise of the common agricultural policy , in order to ensure farmers a decent standard of living on a par with other sectors of activity .
this will in turn ensure that agricultural activity is sustained throughout eu territory .
while these aims are enshrined in the cap , the mechanisms of the policy – placing emphasis on reducing producer prices and on liberalising the agriculture markets both externally and internally – are entirely at variance with them .
we know that this policy has been responsible for the disappearance of thousands of agricultural holdings and jobs , promoting the concentration , intensification and verticalisation of production , the centralisation of land ownership and the growing rural exodus .
it has , furthermore , exacerbated the injustice of the uneven allocation of agricultural production aid among producers , production and countries .
it is this model that , twelve years after the 0000 cap reform , perpetuates the profound injustice that 00 % of the major holdings receive 00 % of aid .
in portugal , 0 % of the major holdings receive almost half of this aid , a situation that we have always contested .
the current reform of the cap , with the decoupling of production aid based on historical references , perpetuates this imbalance .
the decision not to proceed with genuine modulation and the establishment of aid limits was something of a missed opportunity .
aid should not be simply a matter of transferring money to rural development , but should instead act to offset the profound inequalities in the distribution of aid among farmers and countries .
it is also important to point out that reduced prices of products and increased production costs , even taking into account the partial compensation of production aid , led to the disappearance of around 00 % of agricultural holdings between 0000 and 0000 .
not that consumers saw the benefits of these price reductions .
the consumer price index rose , in fact , during the period concerned by around 00 % , while the producer price index fell by more than 0 % .
a determining – and worrying – factor in this situation is the gradual deregulation of the cap ’s market mechanisms , in addition to the fact that these mechanisms discriminate between continental and mediterranean production .
in view of the volatility and uniqueness of the agriculture sector , effective mechanisms must be introduced to regulate the market and to stabilise supply , so as to guarantee farm incomes .
it is also important , as the rapporteur advocates , that we provide adequate external protection for agriculture and that we create community mechanisms enabling us to intervene in any disaster that may befall the sector .
we also feel that rural development should be strengthened , yet this would entail increasing the agriculture budget , not freezing it until 0000 , as decided at the copenhagen council .
increasing the agriculture budget would make it possible to offer compensation to farmers in the least-favoured regions or to those on lower incomes .
this is essential if we are to maintain multifunctional agriculture and high quality farm produce .
mr president , the report by mr garot is plausible and realistic and , therefore , positive , even if not all of the figures that he reports relate to the different types of agriculture that we have in the union ; for example , the 0 % increase in income and the 00.0 % decrease in the number of farms does not correspond to hill and mountain farming , where the figures are , unfortunately , very different : only a 0 % increase in income , but more than 00 % of farms are abandoned .
i would therefore like to mention that hill and mountain farming does not represent a secondary aspect of european agriculture as a whole : it covers 00 % of the useful agricultural area and 00 % of land ; and 0 % of european citizens live in mountain areas .
leaving the mountains not only has economic but , as we know , also social and environmental effects . leaving the mountains means endangering a whole system , the hydrogeological balance and the control of forest expansion .
it means putting an end to every type of agro-tourism , which would lead to repercussions for valley areas too .
what are the possible solutions ?
to allow fixed and suitable compensation for hill and mountain farmers that takes account of the commitment to multifunctional agriculture ; and to launch a specific but comprehensive policy for mountain areas that , for the most disadvantaged areas too , guarantees services and aid to improve the general quality of life and not , therefore , just the economic level of those who choose to live there .
the strong push towards rural development – shown in the recent reform of the cap – gives some guarantee , but it is not enough .
the specific nature of mountain areas needs to be explicitly recognised in the treaties and in structural measures , and we need to have the courage to act with determination to overcome , as far as possible , the restrictions of state aid .
mr president , this area is extremely complex , but it is most important that we address it to ensure the continuing viability of our farms and rural areas .
comparisons of farm income can be very difficult : they depend on the base year used – 0000 in this case – and the figures vary depending on whether you take an aggregate , a family , a household or an individual measure .
we must compare like with like .
irish aggregate farm income increased by 0.0 % in 0000 to eur 0.000 billion , and estimated direct payments of eur 0.0 billion accounted for 00 % of this figure .
our farm survey shows that the average family farm income fell by 0.0 % in 0000 to eur 00 000 .
there are large variations , depending on the size of the farm and the system of farming .
for instance , in 0000 average farm family income on the 00 % of farms classified as full-time was eur 00 000 .
on the 00 % of farms classified as part-time , the income was only eur 0 000 .
however , farm household incomes are becoming increasingly diversified .
the 0000-0000 household budget survey shows that almost 00 % of farm household income now comes from <unk> sources , contributing to the future viability of many farms .
on the average farm income in the eu in 0000 , we ranked eighth .
according to the most recent eurostat estimate , average income per full-time job equivalent , adjusted to inflation , fell by 0.0 % in ireland in 0000 , compared to an average increase of 0.0 % in the eu as a whole .
the distribution of direct payments in ireland may be more equitable than in other eu countries , as there are relatively few very large farms , particularly arable farms .
while the top 00 % in the eu receive 00 % of direct aid , our farm survey shows that approximately 00 % of payments went to the 00 % of farmers with the highest family farm income .
the concept of crisis management systems needs careful handling .
public intervention in agricultural insurance systems would lead to cherry-picking by the private sector , and the european union could be left covering the highest or <unk> risks , which would be very expensive and lead to considerable budgetary problems .
i welcome the reduced rate of modulation agreed by the council .
a higher rate would mean a higher cut in direct payments and therefore in farm incomes .
before any rate is decided on , the first step should be to evaluate the community 's rural development needs , cost them and then set the appropriate rate to meet the cost .
i am opposed to a major redistribution of direct payments , as suggested .
the purpose of the mid-term review reform is to promote competitiveness while securing the income of farmers in a situation where payments would no longer be coupled to production .
i have always supported the concept of decoupling . the aim is to avoid a major disturbance of production patterns and land values .
farmers have established entitlements and any redistribution would lead to losses and gains .
redistribution would also impact on production decisions by farmers , whereas the intention was to respond to market signals rather than force change upon them because of a fundamental change in the level of support .
the cap reform has changed the policy framework to ensure a more market-oriented and sustainable agriculture and food industry .
the options for decoupling direct payments will allow these payments to be made safe from wto challenges and so protect their contribution to farm incomes and to the rural economy .
furthermore , the report calls for consideration of the fact that the reduction and the fall in agricultural prices has not in fact had any effect on consumption .
having said that , however , and at a purely theoretical level – and all the members of the committee on agriculture and rural development know my position as regards the proposal for mid-term revision – i believe that we have taken on a huge responsibility , the effects of which we will be able to analyse only in a few years ’ time , since the formula chosen for regulating the markets and stabilising prices – aid for production that is direct , fixed and de-coupled – will lead us to gradually dismantle the agricultural sector .
we made choices based on a vision rather than on a foreign policy as regards cancún .
we have seen the results of cancún , and we have seen how the talks at geneva have been resumed .
among other things , i believe that some figures in the garot report – the 0 % increase in agricultural prices from 0000 to 0000 – refer to historical prices and do not , for example , take into account the inflation rate that has a marked effect upon agricultural prices .
the whole of the agricultural situation projected until 0000 in the european union is , in my opinion , very much more sensitive , and with much more complicated rules , than the situation presented by mr garot .
– mr president , ladies and gentlemen , let me too start by thanking mr garot for his own-initiative report .
income policy in the agricultural sector has a direct influence on the attractiveness of the farming life , and consequently on the continuation of agricultural production ; connected with the effect it has on rural development .
europe ’s farmers enjoy very widely differing levels of income .
in recent years , agriculture has had to cope with profound structural change , and that is not yet over .
between 0000 and 0000 alone , the number of farms in the eu has decreased by an average of 00.0 % .
european farmer ’s income consists in part of direct payments and not merely of production yield ; moreover , the fall in prices for basic agricultural produce bears no relation to the way the prices paid by consumers for food have changed .
in future , too , production costs will increase as a result of the greater demands made of agriculture , while farmers ’ compensation payments will not be increased correspondingly .
what compensation payments must do is to guarantee that society ’s needs are met : the desire for healthy and safe food and for an environment fit to live in .
compensation payments for agriculture are justified insofar as they reward its multifunctional services to society , above all – as mr santini said – in the mountainous , less-favoured , and peripheral regions of the eu .
the european union ’s agriculture will also need a strong dose of entrepreneurship and an underlying production role .
farmers ’ understanding of their own occupational role and their social status increasingly depend on to what extent the agricultural policy promotes farming enterprise .
it is at this that the individual instruments must be targeted , but the common agricultural policy must not permit the first pillar to be played against the second .
nor may we disregard the requirement that these agricultural policy instruments be provided over a specified period , thus making it possible to plan and act within a longer timeframe .
there is no getting away from the financial perspective as a means of giving our farmers , to some extent , the certainty they need in order to plan ahead , which agriculture and rural areas need .
mr president , a sincere thank-you to mr garot for a constructive report that is very good at depicting today ’s agricultural economy .
agricultural economics is a very important subject for the development of thriving rural areas .
thriving rural areas are entirely dependent upon the existence of profitable farms .
in a europe in which 00 % of farmers are over 00 years of age and only eight per cent under 00 , a whole new attitude to agriculture ’s entrepreneurs is required .
if i were now asked to give advice to people who had recently started up a farm , i would reply that they should make their financial calculations without reference to funding by society and not rely upon the good will of politicians .
the report contains a number of points i cannot support .
for example , it talks about ensuring ‘ a fair standard of living for the agricultural community and <unk> [ ing ] incomes with a view to maintaining farming activity throughout the european union ’ . a second point emphasises the importance of ‘ maintain [ ing ] the level of public support for agriculture ’ and the significance of creating ‘ conditions that will guarantee employment ’ and so forth .
if these sentences , worded as they are , were read out to today ’s farmers , they would leave them cold .
in a country like sweden , these words do not correspond to reality . only 0.0 per cent of the population are now farmers .
restructuring is taking place incredibly quickly . the mid-term review has meant that everything has stopped , apart from the running down of agriculture .
that is not of course something that can be blamed solely upon the european community .
a lot of the blame lies , for example , with the swedish government .
thank you very much , mr <unk> .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 00 noon .
. successful – that is , profitable – agriculture is an essential part of the rural economy and a major influence on the viability of basic rural services , from schools to post offices .
many <unk> in scotland are facing major pressure on net incomes .
in addition to the farm-gate price pressures which all farmers face , scots producers , especially those in highland and island areas , have to cope with high costs of transportation and other challenges such as climatic conditions .
scots food producers must be encouraged by the new cap to capitalise on their already good reputation for natural production methods and resulting production of good quality and healthy foodstuffs , which consumers will want to choose .
the next item is the debate on the report ( a0-0000 / 0000 ) by mr graefe zu baringdorf , on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development , on agriculture and agricultural research in the framework of cap reform ( 0000/0000 ( ini ) ) .
. – mr president , i believe that this report , with the short debate on it that is shortly to follow , fits in well with what we have been discussing : not only avian influenza , but also mr garot ’s report , which has shed light on the difficulties faced by european agriculture , whilst also stressing its significance by reason of the multifunctional role given to it and in view of the status of agriculture as a dominant factor in the overall ecological and social balance of agricultural landscapes .
consideration must be given to why it is that agriculture is in such a difficult position in this respect , even though the european union is one of the areas importing the most agricultural produce and food .
why – for this is the theme of the report – does the sixth research framework programme allocate only 0 % of its funds to agriculture ?
this does not do justice to the importance of agriculture , and it must also be noted that the research into agriculture announced in this framework programme is to a large extent aimed at rationalising production rather than at the sustainability issue .
take the problem of genetically modified organisms , for example : although it must be admitted that a vast amount is spent on genetic engineering , little is being done as regards coexistence and the sustainable and long-term cultivation of crops that have been genetically modified alongside those that have not .
let me return , though , to this morning ’s consideration of avian influenza .
we cannot fail to notice that , in the countries where it occurs , certain breeds adapted to industrial production are in conflict with the traditional and indigenous breeds .
the former have developed an immune system that can deal with certain diseases , but now have to contend with genetic defects capable of affecting the immune system of the indigenous breeds .
as a result , this is where the pandemics then strike , and the indigenous breeds are culled – that is , destroyed – so that these countries ’ genetic resources , vital above all for their subsistence farming and food sources , suffer as well .
the question must be asked – and this would be quite a research topic – why these industries go to these countries in the first place .
do they do it in order to sort out the problem with hunger that exists there , or do they do it because of better production conditions and opportunities to make a better return on the capital they invest ?
look into the situation and you will discover that neither these industries nor their capital generally belong to these countries ; instead , the capital originates here , here in the industrial nations , which want to do business there , and then we in this house lament – as does mr garot in his report – that our agriculture is producing less .
it is no longer competitive , because these countries work to different social , environmental and hygienic standards .
comparative studies of that would be extraordinarily important .
i have mentioned subsistence farming , which is an important source of food not only in these countries , but also in the eu ’s new member states in central and eastern europe .
this is something else into which research should be done .
in this report , we have attached the utmost importance to the question of the role played by women in the work done .
most women working in industrialised farming work in <unk> jobs , whereas , in other fields of agricultural activity , they tend to play leading roles on which the maintenance of these landscapes depends .
the point we are generally trying to make is that we expect more attention to be given to agriculture when preparing the next – that is , the seventh – research framework programme , and that the expected results of agricultural reforms in the european union and of changes elsewhere in the world should be accompanied by research that will provide us with insights as to what the direction of our policies should be in the coming years and decades .
. mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to start by warmly thanking mr graefe zu baringdorf for this report and also thanking the members of your house for the initiative they have taken .
the commission welcomes this report , which we see as a good basis on which to prepare the seventh framework programme for research and technological development , and as something of which it can make use .
as you are aware , the decoupled payments under the new common agricultural policy will enable farmers not only to become more competitive , but also to respond better to the market ’s requirements .
this is where research can also make an essential contribution to improvement , by helping to develop more efficient production processes , by means of diversification and by introducing new and competitive crops .
it can also help enable farmers to fulfil the demands of what we term cross-compliance , and , above all , to provide a sound scientific basis for our understanding of good agricultural and environmental practice , that is , of what is meant by a healthy condition .
what the regions want and need is set out in the rural development programmes , in which local stakeholders , civil society and the scientific community must also be involved .
that was one of the conclusions reached at last year ’s conference in salzburg .
let me now briefly address some of the statements and recommendations made in the report .
although it is quite clear that the sustainability of agriculture must be one of the priorities of research policy , the content of the sixth framework programme has already largely been laid down , and only minor changes can be made to the annual work programmes , so we have to devote a great deal of attention to preparations for the seventh framework programme .
the commission gives priority to research into alternative production methods and sources of income in rural areas , as well as to the endeavour to get away from the piecemeal approach in favour of research into the whole chain – in a sense , from the farm to the table .
issues of the safety and quality of food continue to play a very special part in this .
it is also important that the public be involved in debates about research , and that the results should be evaluated .
these considerations prompted the organisation of the conference ‘ science at the service of society ’ <unk> and 00 october 0000 , and a second conference on this subject will be held in february 0000 .
research into improved marker vaccines must be extended to include other diseases on list a , although budget limits must of course be adhered to .
the same applies to research into medicines for minor species and into plant protection products for plants that are not widely cultivated .
in both these areas there is the ever-worsening problem of dwindling interest on the part of private-sector researchers , it being apparent that profits will not be as high as they would be if large quantities of medicines or plant protection products were involved .
this , i believe , is where the public sector has a contribution to make .
i also share the view that social and environmental research into sustainable development in rural areas has to be stepped up , and that there is a particular need for research that is capable of supporting women in their roles in rural development – something that mr graefe zu baringdorf mentioned earlier .
although the subsidiarity principle must not be lost sight of , i do share the view that ‘ on-farm ’ research needs to be encouraged , with the accent on suitable farming methods and diversification .
prioritised under the heading of ‘ scientific support to policies ’ , research is already being done into the utilisation of agricultural raw materials .
as its predecessors did , the current framework programme funds projects in the field of environmentally-friendly cultivation and related to low-cost farming methods , although it must be remembered in this context that , particularly when we are in the middle of a wto negotiating round , there is also a need to produce research material relevant to international issues and , in particular , also to issues relating to developing countries .
i would not wish to conclude this speech without mentioning the fact that we must not simply ignore research into biotechnology , for it is another area in which we can expect results of potential use to us in the agricultural sphere , provided that sufficiently intensive research is carried out .
overall , the commission acknowledges the importance of parliament ’s report and also the need for a communication on the future direction , structure and promotion of agricultural research in europe , which it will also produce .
– mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to begin by thanking mr graefe zu baringdorf very warmly for producing this own-initiative report .
the commissioner ’s remarks confirm how important this initiative is .
the sixth framework programme for research currently has a budget of around eur 00 billion , of which a maximum of 0 % may be allocated to agriculture and rural development .
this very welcome own-initiative report calls for an increase in the funding allocated to agricultural research from the eu ’s research budget .
we have made a clear decision in favour of the european model of agriculture , which means that we are committed to maintaining multifunctional and sustainable farming in all regions of europe .
further development and research are inextricably linked .
to conserve resources in response to socio-economic and environmental conditions , further research in the areas of organic farming , extensive agricultural management and , above all , non-food production is essential .
developing knowledge in the use of renewables for energy and materials must be pursued as a survival strategy .
as the report points out , priority should be given to improvements in yield security , quality of life and environmental compatibility .
on-farm research is an indispensable tool in the integration of nature conservation and agriculture , and above all in the sustainable maintenance and use of organic habitats in the agricultural landscape .
this report is intended to draw attention to the fact that agriculture research is also important for society and should be given greater priority .
again , i welcome this report on behalf of my group .
at the vote in committee , greater priority was given to biotechnological research than was originally the case in the report , as we took the view at the outset that biotechnological research already has good programmes .
a well-functioning rural environment is inseparably linked with a well-functioning system of agriculture .
as a representative of farmers and rural regions , i welcome this report , and it is our genuine hope that these demands will finally be heard in the seventh framework programme for research .
mr president , the common agricultural policy is beginning the greatest transformation of its entire history ; it would therefore be a serious mistake to keep research within parameters which have become obsolete .
we must therefore change the approach we have taken so far to agricultural research .
this is precisely the challenge faced by mr graefe zu baringdorf in this european parliament initiative report .
he deals with it very sensibly in a report which i believe to be excellent .
he essentially proposes that the sixth and seventh framework programme for research should change in accordance with this new situation .
the commissioner has told us that the sixth programme is being applied – and the report says this – but nevertheless i believe that we do have time for the commissioner to introduce certain modifications relating to the role of women in rural development , as it appears he is going to do .
it is also very important that the drawing up of this seventh framework programme for research should reflect this approach , which considers research into sustainable agriculture and rural development .
paragraph 0 is fundamental , proposing that at least half of the budget for food technology and agricultural research be dedicated to sustainable and practical research into the various farming systems , and i would therefore be grateful if the commission could also provide for this allocation of at least half of the budget for this purpose .
the report supports research intended to improve the quality and safety of foods from farm to table and stresses the importance of small-scale farming and of small - and medium-sized retailers .
in this way a totally innovative potential is established , because we must remember that , until now , this small-scale agriculture had been completely forgotten .
small - and medium-sized retailers had also been forgotten in the intensive agriculture of the past and the immediate future .
all of this had been relegated within research and is quite rightly what the rapporteur now advocates as a profound change , an approach which reconsiders agricultural research from top to bottom , as is necessary , in other words , reorienting research towards the service of agriculture in harmony with nature .
for all of these reasons , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur once again and ask the commissioner to change this approach as soon as possible and allocate the funds requested today by the european parliament .
– mr president , this own-initiative report on agriculture and agricultural research has my full support .
i too take the view that the right approach has been adopted by addressing future-oriented issues on the basis of an analysis which preceded this own-initiative report .
i hope , of course , as previous speakers have already said , that the commission will draw the right conclusions , for the cap reform in particular has brought about a paradigm shift in european agriculture and i hope that scientific monitoring will be effective here in future too .
i think it is right , and would like to reiterate here , that the budget for the next framework programme has been set on the basis of proposed projects .
i am unsure how the 0 % is arrived at , but i think it probably conceals projects as well .
in the settlement of the current programme , it will be very interesting to see exactly what has happened .
agricultural research is generally multiannual , and i have been told about projects undertaken within this multiannual research framework that have never entered their final phase due to budget cutbacks .
the member states are also very keen on cutting research funding .
yet any research that does not produce results is a waste of resources .
in the previous debate , complex issues relating to more intensive research into income and income generation options were discussed in more detail .
it will be very interesting to see how this will look in future , who will be dealing with it , and in which areas , under which conditions and with which assumptions .
i too agree that the complex research areas of food and food safety must be addressed in particular .
everything else , however , has been set out so comprehensively in the report that it requires no further comment from me .
mr president , recent cap reform will result in some fundamental changes , particularly at farm level .
the decoupling of payments from production provides a new freedom to farm with , i hope , new opportunities .
if we believe , as i do , that the european agricultural model must be multifunctional and sustainable , equally it must be commercially viable and competitive .
on the basis that the sector is likely to enjoy budget stability until 0000 , we must use this time to initiate practical research as to how best to achieve this objective .
it would be foolish and foolhardy to believe that the current level of budget support for agriculture will continue indefinitely .
what would happen if this unthinkable scenario became reality ?
the only insurance is positive planning based on properly focused research .
two per cent of the current eu research budget for the entire agricultural sector does not facilitate the achievement of this objective .
in conclusion , i congratulate the rapporteur on his initiative in addressing this very timely and important question .
thank you very much , mr hyland .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 00 noon .
the next item is the debate on the report ( a0-0000 / 0000 ) by mr souchet , on behalf of the committee on fisheries , on the proposal for a council regulation establishing measures for the recovery of the northern hake stock ( com ( 0000 ) 000 – c0-0000 / 0000 – 0000/0000 ( cns ) ) .
. mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to start by thanking mr souchet for producing this comprehensive report on the recovery of the northern hake stock .
the council discussed the recovery plan for hake in december 0000 and accepts some of the proposed amendments set out in the report : firstly , we have now deleted fishing effort from the proposal .
secondly , we have reduced the minimum safe level according to the precautionary approach from 000 000 tonnes to 000 000 , and the critical limit from 000 000 tonnes to 000 000 , as recommended by the scientists .
despite these amendments , the objective remains the same .
the aim is to restore northern hake stocks to safe biological limits , which entails a number of measures .
firstly , we must set a critical limit below which , according to scientific advice , stocks would be at risk of collapse .
we must also set guidelines on the establishment of total allowable catches ( tacs ) based on a scientific evaluation .
the tac will be set according to the precautionary approach unless it results in a reduction in the biomass in any given year .
if the size of the stock falls below the minimum level , the council must reduce the tac .
however , the tac may not vary by more than 00 % year on year .
finally , the proposal also contains measures for more effective control of vessels catching north sea hake , as well as provisions for the prior notification of landings .
landings of more than two tonnes of hake may only take place at authorised ports and stricter provisions on storage and transport also apply .
so much for the proposal ; i will comment on the proposed amendments in my closing statement .
thank you .
mr president , commissioner – whose presence we are grateful for – ladies and gentlemen , i would like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur , mr souchet , on the wonderful report he has presented to us , on an issue which was not at all easy – northern hake .
firstly , the commission presented us with a proposal which , initially , was combined with cod – and which our parliament rejected , as has been said already .
secondly , it made a separate , but very rigid and severe , proposal , which compared northern hake with cod , with a genuine recovery plan and with fishing effort .
our parliament had been consulted at the same time as the council , and the negotiations were carried out in parallel , which obliged our rapporteur to be flexible in terms of adopting our draft report .
mr souchet has made a serious study of issues relating to hake – as he has said , our committee on fisheries spoke to the sector – and has presented a report which fundamentally changes the commission 's original conceptions , for which he has our full support and thanks .
i would also like to thank mr souchet for having accepted the numerous amendments which we had presented on behalf of the group of the european peoples ’ party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats – i am truly grateful to him for this – since we have ensured that it is not a recovery plan , but rather a genuine management plan .
i would like to draw the commission 's attention to this issue : it is a genuine management plan without fisheries effort , in accordance with the sector 's request .
the souchet report is coherent , solid , reasonable and combines the defence of sustainable and responsible fishing of northern hake with the social and economic aspects of the fisheries sector .
the combination of these two aspects is something fundamental which we hope will be taken into account in the future .
we believe that the future regional advisory councils will have to help us not to take false steps and to present proposals for the management of fisheries resources which have the consensus of both scientists and the sector itself .
we have also appointed mr souchet rapporteur for the future management plan for southern hake .
although it will possibly be the next parliament established following the june elections which has to deal with this issue , the committee on fisheries will have to hold the necessary meetings so that , having heard the advisory councils which are created in this regard , both scientists and the sector can take part in the debates on southern hake , and this must take place in parallel with the socio-economic measures we have requested and adopted already in the modification of the fifg .
and more importantly : in the future , the fifg will have to provide for socio-economic measures so that , when any recovery or management plan is adopted , it is automatically accompanied by the corresponding socio-economic measures .
we congratulate mr souchet once again and we hope that by means of this report , which we will vote on tomorrow , we will have taken a very important step in terms of supporting sustainable fisheries and the fisheries sector .
mr president , on 00 june 0000 the commission published a new proposal aimed at guaranteeing the sustainable recovery of the northern hake stock and its reduction within what is considered the safe biological limit , a precautionary level of biomass which is set at 000 000 tonnes .
the first innovation , which we should be grateful for , is that the commission has finally decided to separate stocks of hake and cod into two different plans .
there was no other choice following the clear improvement in hake stocks , a direct result of the management measures applied by the sector over the last two years .
when we move on to the analysis of the measures proposed , we discover that the commission is not taking account of the best scientific information available , nor is it dispelling the doubts of the fisheries industry , since once again there has been no dialogue with the scientists and the proposal has been drawn up without the serious participation of professionals .
the commission is working on the basis of scientific opinions the content of which it does not specify and which , as the rapporteur , mr souchet , quite rightly says in his explanatory statement , has not been revealed to the committee on fisheries either , despite our having requested it .
the precautionary biomass should have been established on the basis of these scientific reports which do not exist .
neither does it appear that this biomass is in proportion to the state of the stock affected , since the latest independent scientific reports and observations of professionals demonstrate that it is not below the safe biological limits .
neither do we have scientific evaluations from the ices which guarantee to us that the reduction of fishing effort proposed will lead to an effective reduction in catches , nor an evaluation of the effects of the technical recovery measures – which i referred to earlier – which have been applied for two years and have had such good results .
neither does the commission ’s proposal seek a balance between biological recovery and socio-economic repercussions .
once again , i must point out that the approach is based on exclusively biological considerations and does not take account of the socio-economic context when recommending the re-establishment of stocks within one year , rather than adopting a progressive approach , based on multi-annual tacs , and this is incompatible with the capacity for survival of the companies in this sector .
the technical measures , which , as we have said , have produced good results , are completely overlooked .
mr president , the northern hake stock is outside safe biological limits .
this is basically ices ' way of saying that it is in deep trouble .
that is why the commission has been trying for some years to convince the council of the need for a recovery plan .
the recovery plan proposed had a number of positive elements , including a formula for setting tacs and a reduction in fishing effort .
nonetheless , in its 0000 assessment ices noted that the reductions indicated in the proposed plan are very far from achieving cuts in fishing mortality that could rebuild the stock in the short term : in other words , ices is basically saying that even the commission 's proposal was not enough to ensure rapid stock recovery .
what have the council and the committee on fisheries done ?
they have seriously weakened what was already a very weak proposal , primarily by removing any vestige of a reduction in fishing effort : the very thing that is most needed .
council even went one step further by increasing the tacs for hake by almost a third where the commission had recommended a reduction .
in december 0000 it was announced with great ado that the reform of the common fisheries policy was a great success and , amongst other things , it was said that recovery plans with effort reduction were to be applied .
but at the council meeting in december , the council set 000 tacs in total .
as an indication of the seriousness of the situation the commission recommended cuts of greater than 00 % for a quarter of them – that was 00 stocks .
but the council rejected much of that advice .
for 00 stocks it set tacs that were more than 00 % higher than the commission 's proposal .
in some cases it set tacs at double , or even treble , the recommendations .
for ten stocks they adopted an increase where the commission had recommended a decrease .
if this is the way council and the fisheries committee are going to continue they are basically proving correct the cynics and all those who said that the reform of the common fisheries policy was not going to see any achievable result in relation to sustainable fishing .
something has to be done .
the commission is too soft on this issue and it needs to be more radical .
the council needs to take a realistic approach to the situation facing the fisheries industry and listen to the scientists ' advice .
it must listen to ices ' advice to ensure the survival of the fishing industry in europe , otherwise we are basically voting for its demise .
it is regrettable that the fisheries committee could actually reduce what was already an inadequate proposal by the commission .
– mr president , better a whole lie than a <unk> – that is how i would like to paraphrase a well-known proverb , the truth of which i am experiencing first-hand these days .
it is namely the case that one of my fellow meps suggested to the press that the dutch members of the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , and also of my own group , never reimburse any of their travelling expenses .
radio , television and newspapers accepted this piece of information without checking it out properly .
since that time , my fellow meps and i have been inundated with telephone calls and e-mails asking me why i keep money back .
this is bizarre ; the reason why i do not return any money is that i do not declare any trips that i have not taken .
i am aware that many fishermen are in a similar situation .
they do not have to fight a lie but a <unk> .
the situation of northern hake may not be full of hope , but it is not so bad that a recovery plan is needed .
relying on ill-defined data , the commission is proposing a drastic reduction in the quantity of fish to be caught .
recent information from biologists suggests that the situation surrounding hake is not so bad as to call for drastic action , and so i wholeheartedly support mrs souchet ’s report and call on the commission to adjust its plans .
a control plan for northern hake with adequate monitoring and enforcement is sufficient in order to offer this fish species a future .
insufficient scientific research is already putting fishermen at too much of a disadvantage .
it is time for sound scientific research to benefit both fish and fishermen .
mr president , for a minute i wondered whether mr van dam had come to the wrong debate , but i am glad that he turned his attention to northern hake .
i congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
mr souchet is one of the most hard-working members of the committee on fisheries and his expertise in this area has earned him the accolade of being appointed rapporteur on the recovery of southern hake , a report which is currently in the pipeline .
during our deliberations in committee , it was repeatedly stated that the advice we received from ices – the international council for the exploration of the seas – in respect of stocks of northern hake was at odds with the advice of fishermen .
indeed , the fishermen claimed that hake stocks were not in a state of terminal decline , as stated by the scientists .
once again , this divergence of opinion has demonstrated the need for fishermen and scientists to work together in the preparation of management strategies .
it is also clear that the commission must be prepared to listen to the advice of fishermen as well as to the dire warnings of scientists .
in this respect , i am delighted that plans for the creation of regional advisory councils , which mr varela suanzes-carpegna mentioned , will bring together fishermen and scientists .
these plans are well under way and constitute an essential part of the cfp reform package .
had an rac been in place in this instance , i do not think we would have had the original recommendations for drastic cuts in hake tacs combined with severe effort limitation targets which the commission proposed and which have shocked the members of the committee on fisheries .
cuts as proposed would have devastated the sector and caused widespread socio-economic hardship .
i am glad that the commission has revised these proposals in the wake of strong representations from the sector .
we all support sustainable fishing .
we all have an interest in seeing the long-term recovery of northern hake .
however , we also have a duty to sustain the livelihood of fishermen and to protect fishing communities .
a balance therefore has to be struck which links best practice to achievable socio-economic goals .
so , despite what mrs mckenna said , i believe that mr souchet has sought to achieve that balance and i commend his report to the house .
mr president , even though i am not a member of the committee on fisheries , i have now and again ventured to intervene in this debate concerning fisheries .
i am doing so today too .
i am doing so because i am in such despair about the fact that we shall not be able to bring about a strict recovery plan , not only for hake but also for other species such as cod and other threatened white fish .
this plan for the northern hake stock was adopted in december , and the objective was clear : to protect the stocks and obtain an acceptable level of security .
the truth is that the council and the commission together have weakened the original proposal so that it no longer complies with that objective .
i think that the proposal that has now been negotiated by the committee on fisheries is very poor .
i absolutely cannot vote in favour of it because it would further weaken an already weakened proposal .
an absolute minimum would be to stick to the commission ’s original proposal , because stricter controls are needed .
economics and social problems , which are always referred to , are also important issues but , if we do not apply the precautionary principle when it comes to the biomass and fish stocks , we quite simply do not make it possible for fisheries to continue .
that is something we should appreciate .
we have now rejected four or five recovery plans from the commission .
it quite simply has to be realised that neither in this house nor in the council is there any political will to adopt measures that genuinely take account of the precautionary principle and guarantee that we have fisheries in the future too .
i am very concerned about what this will lead to .
i should like more people to fall in with my policy when we vote on this matter , for i am now beginning to become extremely impatient and anxious .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur and thank him for his attitude towards the amendments i have proposed .
the european commission 's initial proposal of introducing a recovery plan for northern hake was not – or at least did not seem to be – anything more than an unjustified transposition of the measures applied to the recovery of cod to this species .
clearly , the executive committee did not take account of the latest opinions of the international council for the exploration of the sea ( ices ) , according to which the hake stock will reach a level of total safety if over the next five to eight years the level of mortality from fishing is maintained .
it will therefore reach a safe biological level , to use the term recently used by the commissioner .
according to this information , it is not necessary to implement a drastic recovery plan for northern hake .
rather than a recovery plan , it would be more appropriate to implement a management plan in accordance with article 0 of regulation ( ec ) no 0000/0000 , in a manner which is compatible and also consistent with the biological and environmental component , on the one hand , and socio-economic factors on the other , within the context of the new common fisheries policy .
that is the will expressed by the committee on fisheries in its opinion : to replace the recovery plan proposed by the commission , which imposes severe restrictions on the fishing effort and extremely serious social consequences , with a management plan which allows for the establishment of a total allowable catch that is compatible with the maintenance of the reproductive biomass .
the european commission recently presented another proposal for the recovery of southern hake stocks and langoustine stocks , and it has not calculated the socio-economic consequences for the sector of the measures proposed in that case either .
a scientific study is therefore needed , as well as the opinion of the new regional advisory councils provided for in the reform of the common fisheries policy .
furthermore , we should also stress – and i will end here , mr president – that the council of ministers for fisheries last december committed itself to consulting the professionals of the sector before drawing up an action plan for these species .
the involvement and participation of the sector in decision-making should not be forgotten given that these decisions affect the viability of fishing , jobs , living conditions and the very survival of families which live in european regions highly dependent on fisheries policy .
and i believe that we must insist on this involvement and this participation .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , following the first plan to recover cod stocks , the commission decided to propose a new initiative , this time on northern hake .
there is a further initiative in the pipeline covering southern hake .
while the sustainable management of fish stocks clearly justifies the conservation of species deemed under threat , measures aimed at limiting fishing must be properly based on accurate and up-to-date scientific opinions , and must take on board the first-hand observations of fishermen .
the deficiencies in scientific research are well known .
parliament has had the opportunity this week to express its opinion on the matter by means of the lage report .
in this context , the souchet report is excellent , drawing attention to the need to keep data up-to-date , based on information provided by international bodies in the fisheries sector .
these limitations have had a devastating socio-economic impact on sea professionals , restricting already limited fishing activity still further .
the figures presented by the commission for limiting the hake catch are such that if they were implemented they would be socially devastating , economically untenable and commercially unmanageable .
it appears obvious to state that socio-economic impact should be assessed prior to presenting any recovery plan .
this , however , did not occur in this case .
such measures are therefore only acceptable if strictly commensurate with the aims of sustainable exploitation of stocks and if their economic impact is taken into account .
great variations in total allowable catches ( tacs ) may in some cases lead to companies converting fishing activity from one species to another , thereby indirectly causing imbalances .
on various occasions , parliament has drawn the commission ’s attention to the excessive inflexibility of the recovery plans .
consequently , a multiannual , flexible and gradual approach would certainly be more suitable , in that it would lead to fishing effort perfectly suited to the state of stocks , which will not be achieved by implementing inflexible plans , with irreversible and socially devastating consequences .
. mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i have listened very carefully to the arguments and problems outlined by the individual members at this stage and would now like to comment on the amendments on that basis .
first , i should say that i reject all the proposed amendments which aim to rename this entire project a ‘ management plan ’ rather than a recovery plan , because it is still a recovery plan .
i think it would be wrong for us to gloss over the situation , although i gladly admit that the situation for northern hake is less critical than for northern cod .
on amendment no 0 : i must reject this amendment as this recital is already contained in the framework regulation on the common fisheries policy .
it is not that i reject it on principle ; it is quite simply redundant .
as regards amendment no 0 and the consultations with the regional advisory councils , or racs , as they are also called , i am pleased to reassure you that as soon as they have been set up , we will naturally be consulting the racs regularly on this issue .
however , we do not need a recital for this purpose , as that is the whole point of the racs – to be consulted on such matters .
i reject amendment no 0 because the hake stock is below the precautionary level and is therefore not yet within safe biological limits .
the purpose of amendment no 0 is to show that we need criteria to determine when recovery has been achieved .
it would be quite inappropriate to determine politically when recovery has been achieved .
that is a scientific issue .
i reject amendments nos 00 and 00 because the additional control measures are absolutely essential .
it is the fishermen themselves who frequently complain that control is uneven .
we really do need these measures .
i can accept amendment no 00 in part and i approve of amending the precautionary value for the biomass .
i cannot , however , accept amendment no 00 .
we should not be setting priorities for scientific evaluations here .
it would be a little too simplistic to say that the practical observations made by fishermen should be given higher priority than systematic monitoring by scientific institutions .
of course the fishermen should contribute their data .
some of the uncertainties surrounding the scientific evaluations are due precisely to the fact that there is a lack of such data , as fishermen only tend to pass on data which they think will influence the evaluations in line with their own interests .
i can accept amendments nos 00 and 00 in part .
the tacs are based on a fishing mortality rate of 0.00 , and we incorporated this value into the proposal at the council meeting in december .
however , i cannot accept amendment no 00 .
after the council meeting in december , the proposal was amended so the council has more scope when setting the tacs .
the minimum level no longer needs to be reached within one year ; instead , the tacs can be set so that this is achieved over a longer period .
consequently , i must reject amendment no 00 as well , as the council must have the opportunity to reduce the tacs in exceptional cases if this is necessary on biological grounds .
unfortunately , i must also reject amendments nos 00 and 00 , for logically , they would mean that the tacs could be amended by more than 00 % year on year , and that is not acceptable .
we must have the same degree of fluctuation in both directions ; otherwise , the rules will be uneven .
i can accept amendments nos 0 , 00 , 00 , 00 and 00 in full .
thank you , commissioner .
ladies and gentlemen , the next item on the agenda was to be the commission statement on salmon , but at 0.00 p.m. we have the commission statement on the financial perspective , which will be chaired by the president of parliament and which is to be attended by the president of the commission , mr prodi , and it cannot be changed .
therefore , ladies and gentlemen , so as not to spoil the statement on salmon , which would have to be stopped after five minutes , we are going to suspend the sitting until 0.00 p.m. .
the next item is the commission statement on the broad political framework for the next financial perspective : making europe prosper – policy agenda and budgetary means for an enlarged union 0000-0000 .
i should like to place on the record my appreciation – and that of the house – that the commission , in response to parliament 's request , adopted this communication this afternoon and has come directly to the house to report .
president prodi and members of the commission , we thank you for that .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , in 0000 when the berlin wall came down , western europe was in the process of creating the great single market , an objective that we set for 0000 .
history decided that the huge expectations linked to integration would in turn be linked to the unexpected hope of unifying the whole of europe in peace and democracy .
since that extraordinary moment , we have taken huge steps forward , and large parts of the democracies born out of the collapse of the soviet bloc will soon be part of the union .
our economy , despite the problems and uncertainties , is enjoying an unprecedented level of prosperity ; in europe we have a quality of life that is the envy of the world ; and , above all , differences in wealth and opportunity between the member states have been reduced over the years : this is a success that no other political organisation can boast of .
we cannot , however , say that we are satisfied . we cannot because , for some time , doubt has been taking root in the hearts and minds of europeans .
this is a reaction to the process of globalisation of the planet with the far-reaching and <unk> changes that it entails .
today , europe wonders if it will be in a position to keep hold of the levers of change in order to continue to control globalisation , or if it will confine itself to accepting the situation and protecting itself against the dangers .
we need only to listen to the questions asked by the citizens , questions that are very simple .
they are asking the following : are the cultural reference points with which we identify going to be eradicated ?
why is it that sometimes – in fact , often – becoming old implies the risk of getting poorer ?
why do young people face so much unemployment and precariousness ?
questions like this give rise to two opposing attitudes : one part of our society withdraws into itself , searching for an illusory security behind antiquated , and sometimes tribal , slogans , which foment xenophobia and intolerance ; but the overwhelming majority of europeans , however , look to us for positive answers and always ask us what europe is doing .
this is a healthy and mature position because it assumes a simple fact : no european country can act alone in the globalised world and no one can , alone , meet the challenges of the rise of the large countries of asia , the technological challenge of north america or the migratory flows from the south .
the strength to meet these challenges – our strength – lies solely in our union .
time has proved monnet , de gasperi , adenauer and schuman right ; we must combine what we have in common ; we must fight for the common interest because that is the only way in which we can protect the individual ’s interests .
ladies and gentlemen , the launch of the lisbon strategy in 0000 was the culmination of our collective recognition of this situation ; in gothenburg , the project was completed , fully incorporating sustainability as a key component , and this strategy generated energy and enthusiasm ; it made the spring european council the high point in terms of control , drive and determination .
nevertheless , despite everyone ’s efforts , this process is faltering .
operational decisions are becoming increasingly rare and , often , we are limited to calls for voluntary action .
why is this the case ?
because , in order to have a real impact , the strategy needs a project that is coherent and verifiable ; it needs to organise the necessary instruments , those of the member states and of the union , which includes the union budget .
we must , in fact , use our resources to increase the prosperity of europe in line with its values ; we need to transform the union into a dynamic knowledge-based economy ; we need to ensure jobs for our citizens and make economic growth socially and environmentally sustainable .
before going into the detail of some of today ’s decisions , i want to explain the spirit that drives us and the procedures we followed .
budgetary planning is about linking resources to needs .
since resources are limited , financial decisions must follow priorities and political choices ; that is , follow and not precede : this is a fundamental concept .
i have stated on many occasions that it is unacceptable to plan the future of our finances on the basis of a simple percentage point .
some have said – in all seriousness too – that the union budget must not be more than 0 % of european gdp .
the problem with this position is that it puts figures before the political project : it is like starting to build a house from the roof .
i understand that countries introducing difficult reforms also want the union to apply restrictive policies ; nevertheless , this approach is incoherent because national expenditure – at the level of each individual state – and union expenditure – incurred jointly – are not interchangeable as they are different in qualitative terms .
the union budget is not unnecessary expenditure that must be reduced to a minimum ; community expenditure funds common policies , that is to say those activities that the member states have decided to manage together ; these are more effective than national initiatives and , in many cases , are unavoidable because they address problems that are by their very nature supranational .
there are many instances , in the life of the eu , where eur 00 spent together is worth more than one euro spent in each of 00 countries .
this is an absolutely essential concept that we should fix in our minds .
making savings in the union ’s budget does not increase national public resources , but only undermines the foundations of the house we all live in .
we must , however , channel the available resources towards the priorities in such a way as to maximise the benefits .
for all of these reasons , the commission discussed the new financial perspective by first examining what needs to be done – that is to say , starting with the project for the europe that we want to see – and then , only afterwards by tackling figures and percentages .
the results do not , however , depend solely on the amount available .
for example , we have established that the current budgetary structure and certain management rules are too rigid and that this rigidity has often put a brake on the union ’s work to the detriment of the common interest . this is not just an issue of the quantity of resources , but also of the way in which they can be managed .
we are , therefore , also proposing a budgetary structure that can respond more flexibly to new and unforeseen circumstances .
i would like to make one final , fundamental observation before moving on to the specific aspects of the proposal .
every organisation ’s financial plan is , as we have said , an expression of its underlying principles .
of the union ’s principles , the one that i would like to stress is that of solidarity between the citizens and the member states , solidarity that sees resources transferred from the richer countries to the poorer countries and regions .
our plan is in line with this underlying political decision and develops it in a new way , by placing cohesion policy more clearly at the service of competitiveness and employment than was previously the case .
there are essentially three reasons behind this decision : it is a choice in favour of coherence , justice and opportunity .
i say coherence because the key objective of our political policies in future years will be to encourage sustainable development .
unbalanced development will spawn rejection and fear of europe in the most disadvantaged and outermost regions , rather than trust and involvement .
furthermore , it is a question of justice because no one can be asked to participate in a joint project without being given the opportunity of keeping in step with growth .
finally , it is a question of opportunity , because experience teaches us that balanced and sustainable development , especially in the poorest regions , is itself a source of further prosperity for the richest regions .
this is the thought underlying the financial plan that i put before you today .
i will now move on to briefly explain the key points .
as i have said , there are three major priorities : to encourage sustainable development , to put into practice the idea of european citizenship and to strengthen the role of the union as a key player on the world stage .
so : sustainable development , european citizenship and the role of the union in the world .
i would like to stress one aspect of the first point .
since the internal market is for the most part already in place , we need to incorporate related policies in the broader context of a growth strategy .
this is a very important proposal , which changes the hierarchy in the union budget : we are now in a position to promote the competitiveness of european businesses by exploiting the fact that they are already operating in a market with no internal borders .
i must repeat that there is only one way to increase competitiveness : through quality , technological development , research and innovation ; in a broader sense , the absolute priority is investment in human resources .
this is the unifying point , the major change in this financial proposal .
it is absolutely essential that we devise a common strategy at european level to link up our research centres and to produce the best scientists and the best academics in the world .
europe and the world of education needs to be opened up to life-long learning .
we have the tradition , we have the ability , we have the infrastructure ; it is now up to europe to invest all the necessary economic and political resources .
turning now to the second point , i have often said that , even now , our citizens may sometimes feel that they have split loyalties : to their city , to their nation , to europe .
one of our objectives will be to put the principle of european citizenship into practice .
the union must work together with the national governments to guarantee the same level of human rights , security , protection and quality of life across its territory .
this involves the fight against crime and terrorism ; it involves the joint management of external borders and of migratory flows that takes into account the human dignity of the immigrants and considers them to be a valuable resource for our economy and our society . it involves , finally , developing services of general interest that are the backbone of our social model , such as health , food safety , education , energy and transport .
above all , now the union ’s final borders are being outlined , the time has come to picture a real european identity .
this will be the new frontier in the decades to come .
there will probably not be any geographical advances , but there will certainly be progress on the spiritual front .
we must , therefore , also work to encourage creativity and exchanges in the fields of culture , the arts , literature and methods of mass communication .
finally , as regards the role of the european union in the world , enlargement and the prospect of the complete unification of our continent , europe will really be able to become a force for stability and a reference point across the world .
the time has , however , come to shoulder the responsibilities that this entails in a mature way .
firstly , we must assume a clear responsibility at regional level by implementing the commission strategy to develop a circle of friendly countries .
over the next few years , we must develop this neighbourhood policy to share projects and policies with our neighbours and to guarantee peace and stability by spreading greater prosperity and our founding principles .
our responsibility does , however , go beyond our role at regional level .
europe must maintain and increase its contribution to growth , because the gap in opportunities and living conditions between the north and south of the world is incompatible with our political , civil and human traditions .
this state of affairs is also not in our interests , and it increases the irregular migratory flows that so alarm our citizens .
the union must , therefore , continue to encourage dialogue , peaceful solutions and multilateral approaches .
we must find a single voice on the world stage , with the ultimate objective of having a joint representation in assemblies such as the united nations , the world bank and the international monetary fund .
all over the world there are people that see in us a hope for peace and a wise and balanced force .
we cannot disappoint these expectations ; we must overcome our differences and , together , propose the model that we have fine-tuned in the course of 00 years of the union ’s existence .
these , ladies and gentlemen , are just some of the many objectives contained in our communication .
to achieve them all , as we are constantly being called on to do , we need a far larger budget than that which we have been given up to now .
nevertheless , the commission is realistic , extremely realistic .
we have worked meticulously for a whole year – involving six groups of commissioners and all of the college on several occasions in various seminars , and also all the directorate generals and every government – and the materials for this huge amount of preparatory work will be published on the internet , if you want , and are able , to use them to make it possible to have a more detailed debate .
we have analysed , assessed , taken decisions and arranged for reforms .
we have decided , not without difficulty , to remain within the current ceiling of the union ’s own resources , in other words 0.00 % of european gdp , plus the acp ( edf ) cooperation funds that have to be entered into the budget .
it is on this basis that we have acted with rigour , determination and clear intent to review expenditure which , by limiting payments to an average of 0.00 % of gdp , leaves us sufficient margin to be able to work calmly .
we are convinced that , even if it is certainly not sufficient to achieve the objectives sought by the member states – and put to us unanimously by the member states – it will be possible , with a sum of this size , to achieve specific results .
indeed , we are concerned not just with numbers but also with the effectiveness of expenditure .
we do not confine ourselves to justifying the need for resources , but we are also setting out a new structure to use them in a better and more rational way .
this means continuing to improve the administrative culture and governance of the european union .
if , in fact , we maintain , on the one hand , that , in a large number of cases , action at european level is necessary and more effective , the commission plans , on the other hand , to involve other bodies to rationalise the implementation of our measures on the ground .
in particular , the partnership with the member states is a relationship involving the ever more active mobilisation of the regions and local authorities .
finally , we are working on greatly simplifying the instruments that are currently used .
to give you just one example , we propose to reduce the measures currently used in the field of external relations from more than 000 to six , each one dedicated to a specific political and operational area .
ladies and gentlemen , the communication that i am presenting to you today is not a technical accounting document ; it is a political declaration and i ask you to look at it as such .
it aims to provide the operational framework for managing the major changes to the union in future years .
the commissioners , the commission departments and myself have devoted ourselves to the task with energy and enthusiasm , and i am sure that you will not fail to see this energy and enthusiasm fully reflected in the results of our work .
these pages are , for the commission , a major expression of renewed trust in europe and its institutions .
we now hand them over for parliament and the council to analyse , and i would be happy if , for you too , they were also a message full of hope and realism for our future .
. mr president , i wish to make three comments .
the first concerns the amounts necessary to meet the aspirations of everyone who wants to see a successful europe in the future – whether that ceiling should be 0 % of gni , or 0.00 % , or somewhere in between – and to remind everyone that today is the start of what will probably be a 00-month process .
even though mr prodi has made a statement , if we go by past practices i do not expect a conclusion on this for at least a year .
in december mr colom i naval , who is the rapporteur on the financial perspectives , presented a working document in the committee on budgets on the appraisal of the financial perspectives from their inception in 0000 to 0000 .
over those 00 years , the average budget implementation is , remarkably , 0 % of gdp .
the council could say that is sufficient , but to get an average of 0 % over those years means we have to spend above 0 % in certain years .
in fact , we spent up to the figure mentioned by mr prodi – 0.00 % – in 0000 .
my point is that this type of flexibility is needed if we are to continue to have a decent average .
if that average has to be 0 % , then there will be years when we will have to exceed 0 % quite significantly .
i am still not sure whether the council 's figure of 0 % includes the edf .
i do not think it does , but that would therefore make it 0.00 % at best .
i want to make a comment to those member states which criticised the stability pact for being too rigid .
they should also see that if there is a case for flexibility in the stability pact , then we do not need rigidity in the european union budget by sticking at 0 % , as some member states propose .
that has been shown in category 0 , where , without the flexibility instrument , we could not have financed the actions in kosovo , serbia , afghanistan , iraq or in other areas .
we need that flexibility in the budget .
speaking in a personal capacity , we could manage within the 0 % if those same member states had not already agreed that agricultural expenditure should be set in concrete up to 0000 .
my second comment is specifically to the council .
to get an agreement on the new financial perspectives needs an interinstitutional agreement .
i just want to remind the council that we are one of those institutions , and it will need parliament 's agreement to get an interinstitutional agreement .
we do not care if we do not get it : we will just go back to article 000 of the treaty and will still manage the budget without the council 's say-so .
that is not a threat , it is just a comment to the council , which it should bear in mind as we go through this procedure .
my last point is that for almost the past 00 years – all the time i have been in this parliament and on the committee on budgets – the rapporteur for the financial perspectives has been mr colom i naval .
this will probably be his last plenary session – i am breaking news here .
he will be offered the job of head of the court of auditors in the catalan government , and no doubt will be taking it up very shortly .
i want to pay tribute to his unceasing work ; he knows more about this subject than anyone else – dare i say , <unk> so !
he can quote the interinstitutional agreement chapter and verse , but i have been glad of it on many occasions .
i want to thank him for all his work over those 00 years , and also wish him well for his new post .
i hope i express the whole of parliament 's wish in that sentiment .
mr wynn , thank you for your contribution and your announcement in respect of the future of our colleague , mr colom i naval .
on behalf of the house i should like to congratulate mr colom i naval on the nomination .
we wish him well , but express regret that as a result of his taking up this appointment we shall lose him before the end of this legislature .
mr president , we welcome the debate this afternoon .
as the commission president has announced , this is a commission decision already , and to come first to us in the parliament is always an agreeable thing so far as budgetary matters are concerned .
first , from my group 's perspective , we will be taking the view that mr wynn has just expressed : we would rather be very prudent about whether we need the financial perspectives at all .
we had multiannual agreements which keep discipline , which we did not have before the financial perspectives were introduced .
we do not wish guidelines – which is what financial perspectives are – to become an end in themselves .
we should recall very clearly as we go through this discussion that we have the right under article 000 of the existing treaty – not necessarily under the constitutional treaty but the existing treaty – to be able to continue the budget process , and we shall therefore be very careful to see that parliamentary rights are properly safeguarded in the whole process .
secondly , if there is to be a financial perspective , we welcome the ideas that the president has put forward today about better flexibility , categorisation and looking ahead to how money will be properly spent .
let us be clear that there will not be any decision in this parliament about the final nature of this financial perspective .
we also have to take inspiration from mr colom i naval 's advice and knowledge of this .
you and i , joan , had a common view about the last financial perspective and i sense it is very clear that we have a shared view on this one , particularly regarding the length of the financial perspective .
we have made it very clear , in mr wynn 's resolution and in our own group documents , that we do not want a financial perspective to go beyond the term of office of the next commission , because how can one possibly justify in democratic terms that we are deciding for future parliaments and for future commissions ?
we should stick to the term of office of the next commission , which is five years .
to suggest a date after 0000 is to suggest that an old parliament will be committing a new parliament after 0000 ; it does not work .
we will have to come to terms with that fact .
the last thought is that now we are going to have enlargement – 00 countries – we know the difficulties will be very great in managing a european union .
does this financial perspective address turkey in any way ?
or will that be an additional expenditure ?
should you decide in december 0000 to start negotiations ?
for many in my political group , and maybe across the parliament , to start full negotiations with a country when you do not even know what your existing financial capacity is – to run a union for 00 countries in this way – would be extraordinarily inept and irresponsible , because we need to know what the basis will be when we are negotiating with a country of that size .
therefore , in conclusion , please let us avoid , when we come to decisions on this , a soviet-style approach to planning which is going to take us too far into the future of our commitments .
secondly , let us make sure that it is properly democratic and let us not take decisions which we will regret later because we have taken on countries for which we do not have the financial capacity .
mr colom i naval , in the light of the announcement by mr wynn , i do not know whether this will be your last speech in this house , but in any event , you have four minutes !
mr president , i plead for indulgence .
indeed , this probably is my last speech in this house – at least from this seat , as i am in the chair tomorrow and thursday .
mr president , allow me a few moments to thank the chairman of the committee for his kind words and to express my thanks for your kind words and the applause and congratulations i have received from many of my colleagues who came here today knowing that this would probably be my last speech to the assembly from these benches .
i must say that for someone who started their political career in the anti-fascist underground , at the age of 00 , the opportunity to be here in the european parliament has been an unforgettable experience .
i look on my 00 years in the european parliament as a privilege and i would like to thank all of my colleagues , the bureau , and in particular my colleagues in the committee on budgets and all of the officials and co-workers with whom i have worked during this time .
if you miss me , in any event , my new role does not allow me to be paid , as you know , so i can advise you ‘ free of charge ’ .
having said that , allow me to move on to the topic in hand .
for the last time as rapporteur for the financial perspective , i can say that at last we have the promised commission communication on one of the key issues affecting the european union in the years ahead .
until very recently , last friday in fact , we only knew of it by means of press leaks and rough drafts and had had practically no official notification of it until the tripartite dialogue held in dublin .
the commission ’s speeches , and especially that of mr prodi , have given us a more positive image than the text we had seen to date , with which i disagreed due to some of its apocalyptic tones .
in my opinion , we have to have a more positive vision and i think that that must be our approach to addressing the problems and proposals for action in order to ensure economic growth in the union in the years ahead .
i am afraid , however , that once again we are beginning to build the house from the roof down or , to be more precise , from the ceiling down .
we are starting , , from a maximum ceiling for the budget within which we are trying to fit the policies , rather than looking at the policies and the funding they require and determining the extent to which the resources needed to finance them are available .
as far as i am concerned , the commission has to some extent fallen into the trap of ‘ the gang of six ’ : the treasury ministers who call themselves ‘ net contributors ’ , who have proposed staying within 0 % of the ceiling for the financial perspective .
i believe that the most fundamental negotiating tactic required us to go further than that and to be more ambitious , and not to stay within the limits set by the commission – itself and the budget authorities – in 0000 to meet the needs of a european community that at that stage had 00 members .
that is the percentage they want us to retain .
i think it shows a lack of ambition .
we want to increase the competitiveness of the economy , fulfil the lisbon objectives , maintain the cohesion policy , finance enlargement , and solve the statistical problems concerning the flows to the poorest regions of the current 00 member states .
we want to have a foreign policy , a security policy , perhaps a defence policy too , an r [ amp ] d policy , and so on , but where will the money come from ?
i feel it is important that at last the proposal to include a european tax has been included , but still …
we must ask ourselves whether or not these figures are hiding reductions in the so-called political priorities and – i stress – agriculture and the structural funds .
ladies and gentlemen , we should all remind the commission and the council that because of the council ’s systematic refusal , the perspectives have not been included in the treaty until now .
therefore , until the constitution enters into force in the terms approved by the convention , we are under no obligation to sign this agreement or to approve any package for the financial perspective .
i hope that the irish presidency takes note of this with a view to moving the constitution forward as quickly as possible .
i will not go into any further detail regarding the duration , but i would like to raise a couple of technical questions .
what are the consequences of reducing the number of headings to five but increasing the number of <unk> ?
what rules govern the transfer of money or appropriations from one subheading to another ?
if we have a financial perspective , what form will the flexibility mechanism take exactly ?
moreover , we have a figure of 0.00 % but it is vital to clarify the concepts of payment appropriations , commitment appropriations , and the vague reference to gross domestic product , gross national product and to gross national income .
these are questions that , i should mention in passing , could mean a difference of eur 0 000 million .
in conclusion , ladies and gentlemen , the progress of european integration in a united and enlarged europe requires generosity and a broad-minded approach , and it seems that our ambitions far outnumber resources .
i would ask those who are not leaving this house to become a member of the court of auditors in catalonia to stick to their speaking time !
mr president , president of the commission , it seems that some of our member states have been seized by a seven-year <unk> : it is the irresistible urge to scratch around for the best financial deal for themselves .
but in their rush to advance their own interests , the member states are failing to ask what might constitute the best deal for europe .
liberal democrats and reformers believe that governments should first , as the admirable mr colom i naval has suggested , take a long , hard look at what they have asked the european union to do , and then give the institutions the resources they need to do the job .
governments should also ruthlessly tackle waste and fraud , most of which occur at national level , and target spending on our priorities to ensure maximum value for money for taxpayers .
britain , france , germany and three other states have formed an unholy alliance , united only by their zeal to keep down their budget contributions .
even putting aside the wider benefits that the european union buys , the eu needs a budget consistent with its responsibilities .
this year we will integrate ten new member states .
europe is charged with important new responsibilities abroad , and with the task of keeping us safe from crime and terrorism at home .
reviving growth requires progress on the ambitious reform agenda of lisbon .
do the six states really expect the eu to do all of this on 0 % of europe 's gross national income ?
with spending set to reach 0.00 % of gni in 0000 , a ceiling of 0 % in 0000 means not <unk> but cuts .
none of these member states can tell us where the axe will fall .
indeed , i would wager that they cannot even agree among themselves .
my warning to europe 's citizens would be : buyer beware !
these are the same governments who agreed in 0000 to a 0 % annual increase in spending on the common agricultural policy .
if member states demonstrated a real willingness to reform the cap further , it would be easier to take seriously their calls for parsimony .
as it is , we are running this union on just over 0 % of the gross national income of the member states , when the budget of the federal government in the united states is 00 % of gni .
we must continue to strive for savings where possible , but also equip the union to meet the objectives we have set ourselves .
my group believes that the key to better value lies in a modest budget increase , leaving a safe margin for unforeseen expenditure , linked to reform , less waste and more intelligent investment . not promises of smarter spending from member states with no will to deliver it .
– mr president , i have on several occasions , on behalf of my group , denounced the propensity of the european council to set new priorities for the european union while refusing to grant it the commensurate financial resources .
all too often this short-sighted policy has caused us to abandon an area that is deemed to be crucial one day in favour of another area that is deemed of vital importance the next .
it is by robbing peter to pay paul that we have , on average , survived on a derisory budget .
in 0000 this reached a historic low , below 0 % of gdp , which is 00 % less than the ceiling on which the fifteen had themselves agreed for the period 0000-0000 .
with enlargement on the horizon , this short-term vision of the union ’s responsibilities is now creating a potentially explosive situation .
if the six member states that are net contributors to the european budget actually go ahead with their plan to freeze expenditure at current levels from 0000 , many fine promises will go up in smoke !
the major works projects , rather hastily baptised the ‘ growth initiative ’ , risk being buried once again .
as for regional and social aid and the appropriations for the cohesion fund , they will melt away like snow in the sun for the majority of their current beneficiaries and many of their future recipients .
farewell cohesion !
farewell solidarity !
on a social level this is known as cynicism ; on a political level we call it irresponsibility .
i might have severe words for the member states concerned , but this does not mean that i am awarding any plaudits to the commission .
your communication , mr president of the commission , is rather sketchy when it comes to the choices that will have to be made to meet emerging needs .
where is your previous ambition , although there is clearly more to responding to the challenge of ensuring the balanced development of an enlarged european union than just increasing the financial perspective by one or two tenths of a per cent of gdp ?
i would remind you that by 0000 the union ’s population will have increased by a third .
the income of our new members is less than half that of the fifteen and , from many points of view , i do not think that the famous acquis communautaire is doing them any favours .
i therefore remain unsatisfied , mr prodi .
i would add that the commission ’s position is not without its contradictions .
on the one hand , it legitimately expects a number of member states to increase their net contribution to the community budget , but on the other it pushes the cult of limiting public expenditure so far as to take the council of ministers to court for not respecting the stability pact .
polite requests or punishment : you have a choice .
furthermore , many problems remain outstanding .
i will mention just one : the regions that in the future will essentially be deprived of benefiting from the structural funds , despite the fact that there has been no significant change in their situation .
quite simply , the arrival of poorer regions in the union will automatically – i would say bureaucratically – lower the threshold for becoming eligible for these funds .
it is understandable that the forthcoming negotiations are giving serious cause for concern more or less everywhere .
these are all symptoms of what to me is looking increasingly like a crisis in the european project .
after the split on the war in iraq , the ‘ stupid ’ affair of the stability pact and the breakdown of the brussels summit on the constitution , we now have the debate on the budget to expose in a new and edifying way just how bad things really are .
it would appear to be absolutely essential to <unk> europe .
faced with the risk of a dangerous wave of disenchantment amongst the public , as i see it our only hope is to be found in the growing call for a new kind of europe .
the coming months will be decisive in determining whether a beautiful utopia is waxing or waning .
– mr president , i should like to extend my warm thanks to president prodi for this early presentation of the proposal on the financial perspectives .
it gives us , as parliament , as well as the national governments , plenty of opportunity for listing our priorities for the next few years .
after all , the budget is , logically , the financial translation of the policy that we want – nothing more , nothing less .
in this respect , i should really like to congratulate the commission .
it is trying , in an honest and courageous manner , to point out the cost of the content of the plans made by the european heads of government and also of the commission itself over the past few years .
in my opinion , the commission is , in this sense , much more honest than the six net contributors who , last december , said that they would pay not one cent more than they are doing now .
in that sense , i share in the critical attitude of my fellow meps .
one per cent and not one cent more , irrespective of enlargement , irrespective of the need for europe to play a more prominent role in the world , irrespective of plans for european border control and irrespective of the promise to turn europe into the world 's most dynamic knowledge economy : plans of this kind are always announced with much pomp and circumstance , but at the end of the day , member states refuse to accept the implications .
more tasks for the european union , certainly a larger european union , will also require more money .
i would like to urge you to put your money where your plans are .
current expenditure , too , could also , of course , be held up to the light .
cutbacks could definitely be made there , and my group would be willing to talk about this .
the problem , though , is that those very six countries that are fixated on this one per cent also refuse to discuss further reforms with regard to the european budget 's biggest debit item , namely agricultural policy .
it is a policy that is still massively rewarding farmers and is detrimental to animals and the environment .
the net contributors refuse to talk about this for reasons that are beyond me .
it is time we started talking not only about the amount involved or about what mr prodi said about the roof of the house , but also about a really useful way of spending the citizens ' tax money .
in this respect , i have numerous doubts regarding the commission 's proposal .
it wants to set aside a great deal of money under the heading of sustainable development , which is fine – it touches my green heart .
however , what exactly is so sustainable about the proposals you have formulated ?
the commission has developed a whole strategy to stimulate research , but why has this not been done for the environment ?
why have all the plans to make agriculture greener by stimulating rural development at the expense of intensive agricultural production been abandoned ?
why is there not more funding for rural development ?
the european union is also very ambitious when it comes to foreign policy .
the ties with the new neighbouring countries must be strengthened and europe must play an important role globally .
my group welcomes this .
this role also requires an idea about how , for example , future international crises should be paid for , which is what is currently lacking .
mr wynn also made the point that , if there is no flexibility in the european budget , then there is the risk that the bill will always be at the expense of other policy measures .
accordingly , the bill will , for example , eventually have to be paid by our new neighbours , while we are , in fact , trying to strengthen those ties .
more flexibility also with regard to foreign policy is really something that is yet to be incorporated into the commission ’s plans .
i look forward to hearing more about that .
i would like to thank mr prodi for presenting this programme , which can be seen as important , and it is certainly different from what was suggested by the rumours that were going around beforehand .
of course , we cannot , however , claim that it is a great success to have established the same reference figure – 0.00 – that we already had before .
i would like , however , to thank the president of the commission for having reached an agreement , albeit an incomplete one .
that being said , i must , as a young vice-chairman of the committee on budgets , certainly be anxious and express my fears for agriculture , culture , the ten projects , technology , research , the universities and all the programmes that we launched and announced so enthusiastically .
i believe that , in view of the imminent enlargement to the east , we cannot definitely say – and , above all , the council cannot say – that this is a major agreement .
we can simply say that it is a watered-down agreement .
i think that mr colom i naval , whom i thank for his contribution , mr wynn and also the president of the commission will be able to support a young man like myself when i say that i would like to recall the words of a great personality , <unk> de loyola , founder of the <unk> .
he said that he feared the day when no one fought him any longer .
well , i think that we must all fight with this same spirit to see a europe that is certainly stronger , but one that develops more and is able to have more resources for our projects .
– mr president , there is a dutch saying , '' or , to put it another way ‘ grasp all , lose all ’ .
this is aimed at commissioner schreyer , who wants eu spending to reach up to the ceiling of 0.00 % of the gross national product .
this proposal is unrealistic from the outset , given that six net contributors want to restrict the eu budget to 0 % .
the past decades have shown that subsidies for regional policy hardly have any impact , except in ireland .
it is therefore surprising that the commission should propose to increase this item by 00 % .
has the commissioner ever heard of subsidy addiction ?
we propose an automatic restriction of the net revenue of the member states that enjoy a level of prosperity above 00 % of the european average .
annually , they should not receive more than 0 % net of the gross domestic product .
this would give the necessary breathing space for the much poorer regions in the acceding countries .
it is likely that structural policy in those countries is also more effective .
the fifty-fifty distribution between old and new member states , as now proposed by commissioner barnier , is a stab in the dark .
given the narrow margins in national budgets , little political realism is shown by the decision to spend money on <unk> up a european institution that will , at best , be a replica of nato .
one proposal meets with our approval . it concerns the introduction of a general correction mechanism for member states that contribute excessive amounts to the funding of the european union .
for the rest , we would ask the commissioner for multi-annual budgets that , instead of stating more of the same , offer real priorities and realistic , viable options .
mr president , i approve of the commission proposal – even if it is not very substantial , and i support those who highlighted the fact – not to go lower than what was agreed , which is already an absolute minimum for a europe that has grown , that will continue to grow and that rightly seeks to enlarge the scope of its political actions outside its institutional confines in order to embrace a wider horizon .
from this point of view , it is certainly important to support such an approach .
as others have stressed , however , at this stage in the european debate – where it is so threatened by tendencies always to want to do more as well as to want to <unk> and save – the commission should have gone a step further .
thanks to the commission and its sapir report , we know how much we really need to change the priorities of our investments and our budget to be competitive and to give europe the hopes and objectives that mr prodi referred to .
the sapir report has , however , remained in a draw because it worries many people and many governments who do not want to hear talk of certain issues .
so , at a time when the commission has got into the habit of touching on sensitive issues , as it did with the stability and growth pact , there is , for example , this agreement , which seems to be set in stone and which , while we are discussing the cap , we are committed to not touching until 0000 .
this issue should , then , have been included in today ’s communication .
mr president , i agree with the initial analysis made by the president of the commission , mr prodi , when he referred to the fact that recent years have been marked by a impressive collection of dogmas that have been destroyed , of <unk> that have become a constant reality and of constant realities , such as the berlin wall , that have fallen like the <unk> of lebanon , as recounted in the classics .
in my view , that is the context surrounding this commission communication , in which the next financial perspective must address the new circumstances .
this commission communication will have to be supplemented by the own-initiative report to be prepared by parliament ’s committee on budgets and adapt to the new circumstances of enlargement ; the european elections will produce a new parliament and there will be a new commission .
in any event , we must welcome the commission ’s work and the new budget headings : sustainable development , putting the people at the heart of our project and boosting a more visible and effective foreign policy of the european union .
i would also like to highlight very clearly the alternative put to us by president prodi of choosing between two models of europe .
he told us that between the tangible europe , the definite europe , and the europe of the net balance and net beneficiary , he chose a model compatible with the former , which is a higher model , a model of the europe of values , the europe of peace , of understanding , of harmony and of solidarity .
this solidarity must go hand in hand with the lisbon spirit and strategy .
therefore , mr president , i welcome the strategic choice made by the commission today to present a communication that is not based on a model of a selfish europe but on a model that has been capable of making the figures work for the ideals .
– mr president , president prodi , colleagues , ladies and gentlemen , we are embarking today on a debate whose preparation in recent weeks has already been accompanied by a great deal of shadow-boxing , and i am pleased that the proposals are finally on the table so we can talk about them .
i am not so lacking in self-confidence that i feel any need to be bound solely by what others are suggesting .
nor do i feel any need to be bound solely by the commission ’s proposals , just as i see little reason to take the individual statements from the council or parts of the council as a benchmark for myself .
instead , as members of this parliament , which is one of the institutions to vote on this financial perspective , we will address these issues over the coming weeks and months , and indeed over the coming years – that is how long such difficult discussions can take .
in doing so , it is not acceptable for one side to say : ‘ we have an idea and we want a vast amount of cash to implement it ’ .
that cannot be the right approach .
however , the other side also cannot say : ‘ look , you have a bit of cash in europe , see how far you get with that ’ .
both of these approaches are wrong .
here is what we have to do . we must face up to the challenges that we are already discussing jointly , and then work through them point by point .
let me say this : all of us – including those who have been <unk> us with grand words today – will have to be flexible on a number of issues .
we will have to discuss what we want to do in the field of research and development .
at our last session , we agreed that 0 % of gross domestic product should be spent on this policy area in europe .
this 0 % cannot be accommodated in the budget , for then the 0.00 % or 0.0 % or whatever would not be worth the paper it is written on .
we therefore need to talk about budget combinations .
we must discuss what should be done at national level in the member states in future , and we must discuss what we can best do jointly at european level .
we need to do this in all the areas before us .
that includes foreign policy , for example , where the european development fund is currently outside the budget ; we will integrate it .
we will also have to discuss what proportion of international conflict prevention we want to fund from the european budget and what the member states will cover in future .
we have adopted a figure of 0.0 % of gdp as a guide here .
as regards justice and home affairs , we will have to discuss whether we want to maintain europol and eurojust as small units , as at present , or whether we are aiming for further development here .
another question is how much of the fight against organised crime should be funded at european level and what should be funded at local level .
all these issues will have to be discussed .
we will also have to talk about what comes under each budget heading and which proportion is paid from which budget .
i am very flexible here , and i am approaching this debate with an open mind . i believe this is essential , for otherwise – especially given the <unk> now resounding through the corridors – it will be impossible to create the right atmosphere for a substantive joint debate .
i think we have found some good things in the proposals you have presented .
we will be looking at them .
we will of course be discussing with you why the proposed duration of the financial perspective is seven years .
it is important to highlight the fact that this may result in a parliament such as this one – as mr elles has said – being excluded completely from the debate about the funding of the european union ’s future .
a seven-year period could produce that situation .
we will need to talk about the growth rates that you have taken as a basis for your financial calculations .
i think i saw at one point that you are assuming economic growth of 0.0 % per annum .
if we achieve that growth rate over the next seven years in europe , we will have no problem with any aspect of funding .
we therefore need to discuss which statistics you are taking as a basis for your overall figures .
we will have to discuss the structure you are proposing , and whether it is transparent , efficient and flexible .
our interest in reforming agricultural policy also means that we want to invest in the development of rural regions within the framework of general agricultural policy .
is this possible , based on your proposals ?
or will we have new hurdles to overcome yet again in a new financial perspective – hurdles which cannot be overcome ?
we need some measure of flexibility because as several other speakers have said , challenges will arise over a seven-year period which we cannot predict today .
i am firmly convinced that we , in this house , should engage in this discussion with self-confidence .
we have our own ideas and we will set out our vision of the europe we want to achieve .
we will talk about the resources to be deployed for this purpose .
i look forward to our discussions with you .
i also look forward to the discussions with the council .
both of you will have to deal with a self-confident but serious and solid parliament .
– mr president , the commission ’s proposal for a financial framework for the period 0000-0000 is right in its priorities , and i wish to thank president romano prodi for that .
the eu is lagging behind all our main competitors in the areas of economic growth and competitiveness , and that is why financial investment in the prerequisites for growth is the right and necessary area of focus .
research , the encouragement of innovation and the adoption of high technology are promoters of growth .
so is a high-level infrastructure .
investment in transport and energy networks will immediately create new jobs and strengthen business conditions even in remote regions and those where development has fallen behind .
the eu , including its most peripheral areas , must be taken account of in this work .
similarly , investment in the young is crucial .
programmes of education and training must be extended and diversified for youth to be able to <unk> more readily to an international working environment .
another problem and priority is structural and cohesion policy .
the new member states need support for reconstruction and for strengthening their economic environment .
this cannot be allowed to happen , however , at the expense of the economically <unk> regions of the old member states .
that is why the provision of funds has to be increased on an equivalent scale .
if the development promised under the financial framework is to succeed , the administration has to be thoroughly modernised .
the reform of the commission carried out this term is only a basis for reforms .
power and responsibility have to be devolved both within the bureaucratic machinery and from the commission to the member states .
mr president , the community of europe was born out of a desire to achieve peace and prosperity , a wise and two-fold objective , as it is not possible to achieve one without the other .
one of its fundamental pillars is social and territorial cohesion , in other words , making all citizens genuinely equal by combating imbalances and inequalities in existing wealth and opportunities .
in two months ’ time the union is going to be enlarged with the accession of 00 new member states and some 00 million citizens .
its wealth will be far below the current average of the europe of fifteen and if we hope to continue to maintain our two-fold community objective , if we hope to overcome the inequalities suffered by these new europeans , we cannot contemplate allocating fewer public resources to this end ; rather , we should step up our efforts to help .
in this respect , i must condemn the fact that in recent years there has been a reduction in actual community expenditure , payment appropriations in relation to the gross national income , while the latter is decreasing in constant terms due to inflation .
in other words , we are allocating fewer resources to developing the community , and yet there are some , such as the signatories to the well-known ‘ letter of the six ’ , who want to reduce them even further .
i support the commission ’s proposal that there should be no reductions in future .
mr president , mr prodi ’s presentation on the eu ’s financial perspective allows us to make some brief comments on the economic and social cohesion policy .
i do not intend at this time to state whether or not the financial perspective proposed here by the commission represents percentage gains for one country or another .
this is not the reason for my intervention .
besides , in this context , we must not forget that those countries that intend to enjoy community funds as of 0000 have yet to meet their biggest challenges : they must overcome their structural backwardness and must ensure the economic and social cohesion of their populations .
i therefore prefer to concentrate on the political significance of the commission ’s proposal .
if the commission maintains or , should i say , takes the risk of maintaining , the level of financial resources of the eu at 0.00 % of the community ’s gross national product until 0000 , it would be making a decisive investment in the european policy of solidarity , as the only means of achieving the homogenous growth of the entire eu , in the wake of the lisbon strategy .
at a time when we are integrating ten new countries , this must be a prime objective , to which the benefiting countries , be they old or new , must respond with the ability to carry out the crucial reforms implied and presupposed by european solidarity .
parliament has therefore no choice but to offer political support to the commission ’s proposal .
we must also do all we can to ensure that the proposal of the six wealthiest member states – to reduce the community budget from 0.00 % to 0 % of europe ’s gnp – is not allowed to triumph .
we must , therefore , criticise in the strongest terms those politicians who utter fine words on europe and solidarity , but whose real priorities lie in preserving national interests .
mr president , the commission ’s campaign is now beginning for transferring eu taxes and more funds from the taxpayers to the eu .
instead , the june movement proposes a halt to european tax and expenditure .
not a single penny should be appropriated to brussels until there is an accounting system through which we can see what the money is being used for .
for 00 years , i have tried to obtain detailed information about how the eu uses the money we pay in quotas .
there has still , for example , been no success in tracking down the ‘ skimmed milk <unk> ’ who , for many years , was the biggest recipient of eu subsidies in denmark .
we have still not seen statements of account from the secret accounts in the eurostat scandal .
we know , however , that the chief accountant , marta andreasen , who insisted on correct accounts , has now been suspended for 00 months and is banned from showing herself in the commission ’s buildings , where those who have manifestly been responsible for the fraud can go about freely .
this state of affairs does not provide the necessary permission for sending funds via brussels .
the june movement instead proposes that the eu focus on the cross-border matters we cannot solve ourselves and keep away from everything else .
the subsidies to the present eu agricultural systems can be phased out by 00 % per year over five years .
the eu should completely cease giving structural aid to the rich member states .
the poor countries and the new member states should be exempted from paying quotas so that there is real solidarity and not only a redistribution from poor people in rich countries to rich people in poorer countries .
with such a reform , the net payers will get away with paying less tax , at the same time as the net recipients will be in a significantly better position than at present .
at the same time , allow details of each appropriation and item of expenditure to be accessible on the internet .
in that way , we can avoid waste , excess and fraud , and vigilant journalists and employees in companies and other institutions that receive subsidies will quickly be able to reveal if money is being misused , wasted or misappropriated .
finally , just a few round figures .
last year , denmark paid dkk 00 billion in eu quotas .
danish agriculture received agricultural subsidies of dkk 00 billion .
the total net income received by danish agriculture was only a fraction of the direct ec subsidy .
money is flooding out of eu coffers without ending up in the hands of the needy farmers , and this shows , more than any amount of words , the need for a halt to expenditure and tax , including in the eu .
– mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the debate about the eu budget will be tough .
at a time when the net contributors do not have unlimited resources at their disposal and net recipients are keen to protect their vested interests , it will be difficult to achieve a constructive solution .
as this solution , the commission is proposing an increase in own resources .
the idea of granting the eu its own tax competence – the keyword is the ‘ europe tax ’ – is being discussed .
given the difficult economic situation and massive austerity measures being applied in numerous eu member states , the letter from the six governments is quite understandable , in my view .
if savings are being made across the board , then the eu cannot – no , esteemed colleagues – must not shy away from this desire for savings and reform .
anything else would damage the future of the eu and would ultimately be impossible to justify to the public .
in the conflict over the eu ’s future finances , there are two options : either to carry on muddling through , repeating the sins of the past and trying to fund everything at once , or – the second option – to see the future framework for the eu budget as an opportunity .
ever since the decision to admit ten new member states , at the latest , it has been clear that reforms are essential .
yet so far , no one has been willing to grasp the nettle .
is everything just fine in the eu ’s subsidy policy , for example ?
is it clear why the eu subsidises tobacco cultivation while banning tobacco advertising at the same time ?
is it really the clever option to fund the transportation of animals right across our continent and beyond ?
these are just two minor examples .
however , one thing is clear : reforms must happen , and this is an opportunity .
it takes political courage and probably also a political vision of europe ’s future shape , tasks and prospects .
after all , a budget is merely a set of policies presented in numerical form .
– mr president , ladies and gentlemen , this financial perspective must enable us to live up to the ambitions that we have for europe , ambitions that require us to seek increased growth and competition .
to this end , we need to spend less , but spend better .
reform is therefore necessary , not to enable us to do everything nor to continue the ‘ sprinkling ’ approach that we have adopted so far , but to enable us to meet the expectations of the public .
meeting the expectations of the public means quite simply , for example in employment policy , not having any more of these policies of providing secondary assistance or patching up the crutches that are already available .
because if we want to create 00 million jobs , we will need to innovate under the lisbon agenda and implement new policies that are original and dynamic and that foster private initiative .
we will need to educate , inform the public , pursue these policies that we have started to implement , policies that generate jobs , and in addition accelerate structural reforms .
we will need to promote investment in infrastructure , in transport , in communications , in human resources and in research , which is still being left out in the cold and whose budget is in my view far from adequate .
let us nevertheless bear in mind that all of this should meet an objective of sustainable development , a factor in creating stability .
and let us refrain from making scapegoats of certain groups of society , such as our poor farmers , because we really do need them and they need us .
clearly , we find the proposals that the commission has made to us reassuring , and i would particularly like to welcome the proposals for the new regional policy put forward by commissioner barnier .
the choice that has been made seems to me to be an excellent one , because it will provide the enlargement countries with the necessary support without isolating the regions in the current member states that need these funds .
we must actually continue to meet the needs of the areas covered by the present fifteen member states , fostering their competitiveness and growth so as to fight against unemployment .
were we not to do so then the public would simply not understand .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , clearly the european commission is endeavouring with its proposal to strike a balance between the increased financing requirements of enlargement and the difficulties of the short-term economy and the options of the strong member states .
however , sustainable development in the member states must be supported and the role of the european union as global partner must be strengthened .
in addition , the new financial perspective must send out a clear political message about equal treatment and solidarity between the member states and , if you will allow me to dwell on this point , the needs of the regions which suffer the repercussions of so-called ' statistical convergence ' .
the citizens in these developing regions see political cohesion as the main element in making the idea of the european union a worthy idea and i do not agree at all with the view heard in this chamber that there are no beneficial results from this policy .
at the same time , the citizens in these regions wanted and agreed to the extensive enlargement which will be completed in a few weeks ' time .
morally and politically , therefore , it is fair for these citizens not to lose so much that they lose the feeling of solidarity which they have had to date , enjoying its fruits .
clearly , there must be a smooth withdrawal of community aid from these regions , with a transitional period in which support is wound down .
it is vital during this period to safeguard adequate funding .
any thoughts of making reductions , especially large reductions , in appropriations which , it can be presumed , would have devolved upon these regions without enlargement , jeopardise the efficacy of the political cohesion which is under way and , consequently , must be treated as harmful to the credibility of the european union .
– mr prodi , it is difficult not to agree with the situation as you have described it here today .
i have two doubts , which i am sure you will be able to solve : first of all , i come from a long history of militancy in a party that must surely remind you of something , and during that time i have learned that too much realism in politics often means the start of conflict .
it seems to me that your request to freeze at 0.00 % , that is to say at the current level , the amount of gdp allocated – an allocation which , inter alia , is still based on 00 countries , whereas we are now 00 and will probably continue to expand – is a position lacking not only in ambition but also in courage , and i base that criticism on two facts .
firstly , we have just approved a quick start programme for public works designed to relaunch the idea of europe and the single market , in which we need the member states to be involved and to provide resources , which is why i find it extremely difficult to understand the position of the six member states that have called for a reduction in the amount allocated .
secondly , in any negotiations , sticking to a position knowing that some of the member states do not agree with the reference to 0 % , appears to me to be quite a complex negotiating position from a tactical point of view .
the second doubt concerns the timing .
the current financial situation is programmed up to the end of 0000 ; the commission must present a proposal before july 0000 and the agreement must be reached before may 0000 .
so then , why the urgency ?
so that we can rush things through in a parliament whose mandate is about to expire ?
as mr wynn correctly pointed out , our parliament has an extremely important role to play , but that role will be played by the parliament to be elected on 00 june .
– mr president , ladies and gentlemen , neither the restriction to 0 % nor the commission ’s proposal for an expansion to 0.00 % , which amounts to 0.00 % in reality , can be the signal we send to europe ’s citizens and taxpayers today .
naturally , the letter from the six governments so soon after the collapse of the summit was a mistake in terms of its timing , tone and content and was therefore quite unacceptable .
equally , however , in response to the commission ’s ideas – and you , president prodi , have presented some interesting keywords , although we will have to discuss them in far more detail – i must say that what is urgently required in the coming months is a critical review of the european union ’s agenda , with a focus on both positive and negative aspects across the board in all policy fields , if we want to identify honest and practical responses for europe ’s citizens .
naturally , the outcome of our discussions today cannot be binding on the new commission , which will still have to be approved by the new parliament ; nor can it be binding in any way on the new parliament in its capacity as part of the budgetary authority .
as part of this more critical approach , however , it is essential , first and foremost , to complete the constitutional treaty and define the system of powers , also in line with the subsidiarity principle .
this also means that if powers are transferred back to the member states in an enlarged eu , we will need fewer resources for these areas at european level .
however , it also means that if tasks are transferred to the european level – such as foreign , security and development policy – the member states will have to look again at the possibility of not only increasing the eu budget but also reducing spending at national level .
i would like to conclude by raising two points .
after all , it is not just a matter of freeing up budget funds in order to deal with new objectives , improving competitiveness and growth potential . what i think is missing , especially in the light of the mid-term review of the lisbon strategy to be discussed next month , is that here , the commission itself has not established the coherence on many legislative proposals , which is necessary to achieve the binding consolidation that will generate growth potential and entrepreneurial freedoms throughout the european union .
if what you are proposing in the budget is flanked by such initiatives , our credibility will be much improved .
in addition , we see the option of reverting to article 000 of the treaty without binding new parliaments and new institutions as a very exciting one .
mr president , mr president of the commission , representatives of the council , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we welcome the commission communication on the new financial perspective as an interesting debating exercise for the future .
it will not be this commission or this parliament that take the final decisions , but here is the result and we must thank the entire college of commissioners for having incorporated the various sensibilities .
we consider this to be a good basis for negotiation .
a financial perspective that is properly negotiated among the three institutions is a vital element for the rational development of the union ’s expenditure and for ensuring growth , competitiveness , employment , and economic and social cohesion within a framework of budgetary stability .
that is the financial perspective on which this parliament would like to vote .
we would never vote in favour of a financial perspective based simply on accounting calculations or imposed unilaterally by one institution that had not negotiated with the others .
this parliament has already set out its position on three aspects of the financial perspective . the first of those was its duration , which in principle should coincide where possible with the duration of the mandates of the european parliament and the commission .
secondly , we have also stated our support for providing greater impetus for the political objectives laid down in lisbon and gothenburg .
this development takes shape through the union ’s annual budgets and it is clear that without sufficient financial resources there can be no credible objectives .
indeed , look at the 0000 draft budget and you will see what budget restrictions are .
thirdly , we have on many occasions expressed our support for a financial perspective that is capable of fulfilling the objective of cohesion .
cohesion is and will continue to be the major inspiration behind the eu ’s policies along with growth and stability .
the 0.00 % of gross national income for cohesion measures has been incorporated by this parliament and forms part of our approach .
if we cut corners with cohesion policy we will surely fail .
mr president , on behalf of the presidency of the council , i thank president prodi for the presentation on the policy orientation provided by the european commission for the union 's next multiannual financial framework : it is an important communication .
the negotiations ahead will be of fundamental importance for the development of the enlarged union well into the next decade .
what is at issue , therefore , is much more than the financial framework for the union .
it is also the policies and priorities which can best address the aspirations of your citizens .
as mentioned by the chairman of the committee on budgets , mr wynn , the negotiations will run well into 0000 .
however , the irish presidency will begin discussions and give priority to advancing the dossier as effectively as possible .
the president of the commission will brief coreper tomorrow , and on 00 february there will be a first discussion by ministers at the general affairs and external relations council .
our aim as presidency will be to initiate and advance discussions and , in cooperation with succeeding presidencies , to map out how best to process the dossier and lay a solid foundation for our successors .
we hope in this regard that the spring european council might be able to agree on the calendar and process for negotiations .
the council looks forward to working constructively with parliament and the commission in advancing this important dossier .
with your permission , mr president , may i finally join with you , mr wynn and others in the warm expressions of congratulations and goodwill to mr colom i naval and to wish him all the very best for the future .
. – mr president , i will say a few words and then commissioner schreyer will reply to some of the more technical questions .
there has been one general criticism running through this debate – a debate for which i am sincerely grateful , because parliament has genuinely exercised its institutional pride on the issue of the budget and has given us precious advice – criticism made by some important members of parliament , beginning with mr wynn : a lack of ambition , as mr fiori also pointed out , and the assertion that an excess of realism leads to weakness .
so , i should like to point out that the structure of the budget we are presenting indicates a radical change with the past – not only quantitatively but also qualitatively ; it constitutes an ambitious project that will give rise to serious problems and a fierce debate when the time comes for it to be adopted .
we have made choices that are coherent , precise and dramatically different from those of lisbon : we have placed , within the context of an extremely ambitious draft budget , appropriations for the area of justice , which is one of the major areas of the union – it was not by chance that i referred to it as one of the union ’s three lines of action – that is to say funds are to increase by almost 000 % from eur 0 billion in 0000 to eur 0.0 billion in 0000 .
these , i repeat , are radical changes .
finally , the international situation : funds are to increase by almost 00 % from eur 00 billion in 0000 to eur 00.0 billion in 0000 .
so then , we have made some stark choices – which i hope will be accepted – in keeping precisely in line with the objectives .
we did not , ladies and gentlemen , begin building from the roof , but from the foundations , studying the new objectives and analysing what had been decided in previous years with the decisions taken at lisbon and subsequent decisions . on this basis we have constructed a coherent budget so that europe can relaunch itself , re-establish a united policy on justice and internal affairs and re-establish its voice in the world .
there are three areas on which we have consolidated and focused our attention , and therefore this is a response which i consider ambitious ; realistic and ambitious . i say realistic because it is clear that genuine situations , <unk> and even political trends cannot be ignored .
i assure you that the procession of the six ambassadors who brought me the 0 % letter resembled more than anything a funeral <unk> , and it is clear that this makes no sense in a europe that must react , that must go forward , that has enormous responsibilities for everyone .
so , we have taken a major gamble : stark choices , extremely radical choices , as the detailed line by line analysis of the budget will show .
in conclusion , a final observation : why have we started so early , mr fiori ?
out of respect for those who are to come after us .
the timeframes are extremely long .
when , at the end of our term of office , we hand over the whole project with its roadmap , when our work is completed , they will need – so it has been said – about twelve months , possibly more : going on past experience , 00 months will be needed to fine-tune the finished product ; that means the beginning of 0000 , <unk> 0000 .
care must be taken to provide enough time to learn the procedures , prepare the financing procedures and organise the financing structure , which is only just adequate , so that the objectives we have set ourselves can be met .
the work we have carried out is wide-ranging but absolutely essential .
it is clear that none of the decisions taken today will become operative under this term , we are well aware of that .
it will be the new parliament that will decide but , if we do not place the new parliament in the position to decide , it will not be possible to make payments at the beginning of 0000 .
we have worked on this , mr fiori , because i can assure you of one thing : we never attempt to perform tasks that are not useful or are unnecessary .
this has involved an enormous amount of work and perhaps we would willingly have avoided it had it not been for the benefit of the union .
. mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the eu faces major challenges and we must decide whether – and how – we , as a community , will respond to these challenges .
the objectives set jointly by the member states are indeed very ambitious .
by 0000 , the eu is to become the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world ; it is to become an area of freedom , security and justice .
europe is determined to take on more responsibility in the world , and we are about to embark on the historic reunification of the continent and the integration of the new eu member states .
the financial perspective establishes an important framework for decisions on the policies and tools that we will deploy to shape the future together .
in order to achieve the ambitious objectives we have set ourselves and ensure that the union can fulfil the growing expectations of its member states and citizens , appropriate resources must be provided to underpin the policies .
we should not raise expectations and then fail to deliver on the policies .
that would generate disappointment among citizens .
however , we should only provide european funding from the public purse for policies if we can state with confidence – as the president of the commission has already said – that we are creating added value – in other words , if we can achieve greater benefit by spending a euro at european level than by spending it at national level .
at the same time , europe must continue to uphold budgetary discipline .
budgetary discipline means the own resources ceiling , which is set at 0.00 % .
the commission has decided to present a proposal which not only respects this own resources ceiling but also allows sufficient scope below this ceiling based on the average over the period .
however , the commission has also clearly stated that the proposal by the six member states to impose a budget cap at 0 % not only conflicts with the objectives but quite simply does not stand up to a reality check .
the commission is proposing an average level of appropriations for commitments of 0.00 % for the period 0000 – 0000 .
if we also include expenditure for the european development fund and the sound new instrument of the solidarity fund , the appropriations for commitments stand at 0.00 % .
commitments for payments will thus average 0.00 % of combined economic performance , or gni , over the period .
that means that the budget volume that we are proposing can be set at an average of 0.00 % of gni .
let me comment on the length of the financial perspective , as this is quite rightly a very important issue for this house .
the commission completely agrees that for democratic and institutional reasons , five years would be the right length of time .
the question is simply this : at which point in time is it most appropriate to commence this cycle ?
we have discussed this matter in considerable detail .
on the one hand , given that we have set agricultural spending up to 0000 , and since the integration of the new member states into new programmes is no small matter , and especially also in light of the structural funds , and taking account of the question when it is best to start the cycle from an institutional perspective , we are proposing a seven-year period again this time round as a transitional phase , as it were , before commencing the five-year cycle thereafter .
i would emphasise , yet again , the following points concerning the comparison of figures : this commission is serious about the proposal to integrate the european development fund into the budget .
it has been stated repeatedly in the past that this would be desirable .
the measure outlined in our proposal therefore fulfils a demand that this parliament has quite rightly been voicing for years , for we need an integrated and effective policy for the acp states , especially for the poorest countries in the world .
that is why we have put forward this proposal .
on flexibility , which has been mentioned several times here today : yes , we will need flexibility if we are planning so many years ahead .
that is why the commission has said that a revision is always a possible option .
however , we are also planning new flexibility instruments between the categories in order to be able to adjust priorities in the short term . we are also proposing a growth adjustment fund – in other words , a reserve which can be activated additionally if a policy needs to be enhanced for quite specific reasons .
let me also emphasise yet again that the commission is proposing the full integration of the new member states into the structural and cohesion policies .
as you are aware , we have based our calculations on a european union of 00 member states .
throughout this legislative term , which is now drawing to a close , this house , the european parliament , has argued robustly and with great success in favour of enlargement .
at the same time , it has championed the cause of deepening and european integration . in other words , it has always been in favour of more europe and an efficient europe .
in doing so , you have consistently upheld budgetary discipline and have been successful here as well .
these comments are directed to the council presidency in particular .
you are now working – and i hope this work will be successful – to ensure the adoption of the new constitution . a key issue here is to equip the european parliament with more budgetary rights , especially codecision rights in respect of the financial perspective .
in my view , the financial perspective must have the endorsement of the european parliament .
let me take this opportunity to address mr colom i naval .
i am at a loss to know how the deliberations on the financial perspective can take place without your powerful commitment and your powerful voice .
i wish you every success in your new position .
your region is very fortunate in having secured your services in this key post .
i would like to close by citing an irish writer , because we have the irish presidency at the moment and also , of course , as a tribute to the president of this parliament .
oscar wilde once said that we know the cost of everything and the value of nothing .
i think that in the coming months , we will have very intensive arguments over spending .
however , the key issue is not only expenditure , but also community policy and the values of the european union , and i am sure that this house will play a very active and committed role in this debate .
the debate is closed .
– before negotiating the financial perspective for 0000-0000 , it is important to have a clear idea of the political backdrop to this issue .
in this respect , today ’s debate is an opportunity for the commission , as is often the case , to try to win the support of the european parliament for a relatively high level of annual resources , of 0.00 % of gross national income ( and that is without the european development fund ) , against the position of the contributing member states , including france , which would like 0 % ( as in 0000 ) .
this alliance between parliament and the commission is an implicit reference to the idea of a gradual expansion of the union ’s remit , which is intended to lead one day to a federal budget .
i might add that in parallel the commission is launching a campaign for a european tax .
we must avoid any drift in this direction , so as not to sustain a new bureaucracy and not to compromise the competitiveness objectives that were set in lisbon .
the european union , which is at the service of the member states , should not be cornering their tasks , in particular that of redistribution .
it should simply provide the added value that comes from coordination , which only requires slim administrations and limited resources .
it should live from the contributions that the nation states vote for and control on an annual basis .
under these conditions , the position currently held by the paying member states seems to us to be entirely justified .
. this debate on the new financial perspective shows that there is an enormous gap between promises and reality .
what we are seeing is , unfortunately , a repeat of agenda 0000 , when what we really needed was to increase funds , bearing in mind the growing needs in terms of social and economic cohesion resulting from enlargement , and to promote sustainable development , high quality jobs , improved social conditions and cooperation and development policies with the least-developed countries .
what is happening shows the disgraceful nature of the ‘ group of six ’s ’ blackmail in placing a ceiling in the community budget of 0 % of gnp , which would lead to what we feel is an unacceptable solution .
this has also been shown with the commission ’s unacceptable proposal , which does not meet the needs of the acceding countries , growing social inequality , appalling unemployment or the poverty and exclusion that can be seen in current eu countries , such as portugal .
yet the question is not exclusively about finance .
of equal importance are the priorities and revision of the objectives and of the instruments of cohesion and budget structure to which they correspond .
the guiding principle of competitiveness , strategic realignment based on the lisbon agenda , the realignment of foreign policy towards actions within the scope of the common foreign and security policy and the european spatial development perspective , and of internal policy based on questions of immigration policing and border controls , encompass areas that lead european integration down a dangerous path .
the next item is question time , but we will begin with a point of order from mr dupuis , who may address the house briefly .
– mr president , strange forces are at work in the management of our questions .
in december i asked a question on croatia .
it was held over from the january part-session until this part-session .
i thought in good faith that it had been held over because mr verheugen was to have been with us at this session and other members had also asked questions about croatia ’s accession .
nothing of the sort !
furthermore , not only do i find that my question is at the end of the list and not at the beginning , which would have been logical given that it was withdrawn in january , but also i know that it will not be possible to receive an oral answer .
and of course i have not been able to ask another question for february .
i would like the services to take careful note of this fact and for it to be reflected in the minutes of this sitting , because i really do not think that this is as it should be .
there are some very dubious goings-on surrounding croatia ’s accession process .
some countries are blocking it and i will name them : they are the united kingdom and the netherlands .
we urgently need a debate to clarify all of this .
mr dupuis , the commission decides which commissioners attend question time and determines the distribution of questions ; in any event , we note what you are saying and will pass on your concerns to the commission .
the next item on the agenda is question time ( b0-0000 / 0000 ) .
we will begin with questions to the commission .
as the author is not present , question no 00 lapses .
can the commission inform the house of the measures that it is promoting to support low-cost travel in europe , taking into account the fact that the vast majority of eu citizens fully support and recognise the importance of low-cost air travel within the european union ?
. as a result of the liberalisation of air transport in the european union at the beginning of the 0000s – which was in fact based on legislative proposals from the commission – we can see the extent to which competition has increased between the various airlines in the european union and how users are benefiting from lower prices and better supply .
in this context , a new phenomenon has appeared : that of the so-called low-cost airlines .
the commission considers this to be a positive development : it increases supply for passengers , results in greater economic activity and possibilities for consumers , and offers opportunities for lower costs .
the commission ’s action seeks to ensure that this development continues through the strict application of the rules on competition and state aid .
to this end , i must point out that our task is not to support one sector or another , but to provide balanced standards that allow for the development of the various types of aviation activities : the traditional companies with their style of business , and the new companies , described as low-cost companies , which have a somewhat different market and which have undoubtedly generated a significant increase in competition , supply and opportunities for users .
i would like to thank the commissioner for her reply and ask a question arising from it .
in light of the recent investigation by the commission into the arrangements of ryanair at charleroi airport , is it not now the case that regional airports in europe are unsure how state aid rules are going to apply in the future and that this in itself is going to impinge on legitimate commercial decisions they would like to take , as well as on their future development ?
. i believe that , on the contrary , the commission ’s solution and response in the case of ryanair in charleroi – which relates to the state aid given by charleroi airport rather than to ryanair , and that is the problem – opens up new possibilities for the promotion and development of regional airports , which are a driving force for regional development , and for the operation of the so-called ‘ budget airlines ’ from those airports .
i believe that the decision taken by the commission is balanced .
it has given the green light to most of the aid received by ryanair throughout this time .
though it is true that limits have been imposed , in terms of time and above all in terms of the availability of this aid for any other company which is willing to carry out this type of activity , for the sake of equal treatment of all airlines operating in europe and of transparency in these types of operation .
i repeat , however , that i believe the decision on charleroi favours regional airports and budget airlines .
we must remember that in the case of charleroi we have not acted on our own initiative , because the commission had received complaints and because , as the honourable member knows , the commission is obliged to deal with them .
in fact , there have been complaints in relation to other airports in various countries of europe .
we will deal with them in the coming months , when all the facts of each case are clarified .
i believe that we are thereby helping to clarify the situation , because there are a series of other regional airports which , thanks to the response in the case of charleroi , are going to be able to provide airlines with similar conditions , which allow them to expand and carry out their activities .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it has emerged that railway companies are now competing with the cheap tickets offered by the airlines .
how do you intend to proceed with regard to the state aid that is currently being paid to the railways ?
will restrictions on the options apply here as well ?
in austria , for example , 0 % of the budget is spent on the railways .
that amounts to around eur 000 per citizen in subsidies to the railways , which are now competing directly with the privately-owned low-cost airlines .
this means that there is unfair competition between the cheap tickets offered by the airlines and those offered by the railways .
i would be very pleased if you took similar action against the railways .
. i would like to remind the honourable member that we have not yet liberalised passenger transport in the rail sector .
in each country , therefore , railways operate as the country sees fit and they receive the aid which each country is prepared to give them , in accordance with the criteria of public service and maintenance of companies , amongst others .
it is therefore currently possible that budget airlines are competing with railways , but the latter are receiving state support in practically every country .
at a later date , following a discussion on the third railways package , which i hope the honourable members will shortly receive for discussion , and which i hope the next parliament and the next commission can complete , we plan to introduce competition into passenger rail transport on international lines , not on national lines .
when that time comes , we will have to consider the effects this will have in terms of competition , but – i repeat – the aid we have authorised is limited in terms of time and quantity .
in no event may it exceed a maximum of 00 % , of operating costs and , furthermore , they must be decreasing for a maximum of five years .
i believe that this is a balanced decision , which allows us to combine support for a regional airport , which – i repeat – provides stimulus and economic activity for a region .
in the case of wallonia – an objective 0 region which is lagging behind the community average – that is what justifies the support for aid , not whether or not there are cheap tickets .
the fact that an airline offers people cheap tickets does not justify their receiving public aid .
the justification for the authorisation of public aid at a particular time , and for charleroi giving it to ryanair , is the fact that charleroi is a regional airport in a depressed region , in order to provide that region with stimulus and activity , which is completely different , and as assistance for launching new routes and new connections .
we have also agreed on the possibility of granting aid in the air sector when the criterion of public service is fulfilled .
for example , in the case of the outermost islands and island groups , on grounds of internal public service .
in this case too , conditions relating to transparency , competition and equal treatment must be fulfilled .
would the commission please detail how or if it plans to issue information and/or advice to member states on the free movement of labour from accession countries after 0 may 0000 ?
mr president , the commission has already taken measures to inform citizens about the transitional arrangements relating to the free movement of workers .
an electronic guide on the subject of the free movement of workers to the new member states is already operating and can be found on the commission 's website in 00 languages .
at the same time , a printed leaflet will soon be available in all the languages .
as far as the member states are concerned , we must make it clear that the treaty makes provision during the first two years after accession for access to job markets to be the subject of bilateral agreements or national decisions by the member states .
again according to the treaty , the member states are not obliged to tell the commission what they intend to do during this stage .
of course , for reasons of transparency , the commission has asked the member states to notify their position and i should like to inform you that , so far , the united kingdom and ireland have stated that they intend to open the job markets fully , while austria , germany , belgium , finland and denmark have stated that they will apply national measures for the first two years .
austria and germany have also stated that they intend to cite the saving clause in order to limit access to certain service sectors listed in the treaty .
in all events , when we have all the information from all the member states , we shall notify parliament .
in addition , the commission is in regular contact and cooperation with the services of the member states , so that we can guarantee the uniform application of these transitional arrangements and can also proceed to issue certain interpretative guidelines which have to date been the subject of cooperation and consultation with the member states .
thank you , commissioner , for that answer .
your colleague , commissioner vitorino , has also answered this question very comprehensively and skilfully in the past , arguing that the wild numbers predicted for portugal when it joined the european union were way off the mark .
we are now witnessing the same phenomenon with predictions for movement of labour from the accession countries .
my point is that i would not ask the commission to give out information which it has no legal requirement to provide .
i am glad of the cooperation between the commission and member states . but there is real confusion .
the noble aim of enlargement has led to confusion among people on the ground – european citizens – who are now anxious about the extreme predictions of the numbers of people who will come .
i do not agree with these extreme predictions , but the commission has a role to play in giving out sensible information about what we can expect and what it will mean for free movement and , indeed , for benefits regimes – although this is a matter for member states .
that is not coming through collectively .
on a more positive note , i would ask about movement the other way – people from existing member states who , for example , would like to retire in cyprus or work in poland .
we are getting enquiries about that positive element of movement .
will the commission provide information ?
. it is easily understandable that in many member states , particularly those with common borders with the newcomers , public opinion is concerned about the impact on the labour market .
i have said repeatedly that there are many independent studies concerning the flow of immigrants after day one of enlargement , working on the assumption that ten newcomers will join europe at the same time .
the overall conclusion of these analyses is that mobility from the new member states to the current 00 member states is likely to remain rather limited .
as for the questions concerning social rights , let me repeat two things .
first , from the moment that a worker is a legal worker in a member state , he or she has all social rights and access to all kinds of benefits and social security systems .
as far as pension rights are concerned , during the italian presidency we agreed on a regulation covering the social rights and pension rights of workers not only from the new countries , but also from third countries .
that regulation provides a concrete answer to the question of pension rights .
following on from that question , commissioner , i should like to raise the issue of derogation and the issue of regulations that are being unilaterally applied by some countries that have not applied for derogation .
in the case of the uk , it has indicated that it is not going to put any block on the movement of those who wish to come and work in the uk .
now , however , late in the day , it is talking about a number of regulations of a domestic nature , in relation to our social security and other systems , that will have a discriminatory effect here .
does the commission have a view on this approach or is it happy to leave it entirely at the disposal of domestic governments to decide how they will deal with the matter within the first two years ?
mr president , the first two years , in accordance with the council decision on the management of transitional periods , are a purely national issue .
the european union cannot intervene , irrespective of whether this is done with national arrangements and legislation or with bilateral agreements between the new countries and the existing member states .
however , what we need to bear in mind is that any agreements will need to comply with the existing european institutional framework .
then there can be no question of discrimination , because one country wants to have different arrangements from another .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in recent weeks , slovakia has set income tax and corporation tax at a flat rate of 00 % .
as a result , many firms in austria are now planning to open plants in slovakia , which means that they will of course be employing their workforce in slovakia as well .
does the commission have any studies indicating how many workers from the current european union are likely to migrate to these attractive tax regions as industry is relocated ?
will the balance be maintained , or will there even be a clear <unk> of workers from the member states in the first two years , especially since the opportunity to move from the new member states to the current eu will only exist thereafter ?
thank you .
. of course there are studies on the movement of companies from the member states to the new countries , but i would say that the huge wave of company relocations has been completed and today , with the obligation of the new countries to apply european law fully as regards the internal market and the job market , companies do not have the same incentives that they had in the past .
there is , of course , always the problem of low labour costs , but that is something we know , which is why the strategy on employment focuses on the question of investment in human resources and fundamental change in the orientation of jobs in europe .
how successful does the commission judge that the union 's five-year strategy has been – it runs out during 0000 – given the flood of heroin and other drugs on our streets ?
. the eu drugs strategy 0000-0000 provides a framework for a balanced and integrated approach on all drug-related activities in the european union .
it has also been endorsed by the new member states and the candidate countries who have , in the meantime , set up national drug strategies and improved their capacities for taking action against drugs with the support of the phare programme .
the union also has a number of drug action plans involving certain regions either producing or serving as transit countries for drugs , such as latin america , central asia and the balkans .
research shows that a link between a particular drug policy line and the drug situation is difficult to establish .
the availability and careful evaluation of relevant and reliable information are undoubtedly key elements in developing an evidence-based drug policy .
the work of the european monitoring centre on drugs and drug addiction and the work of europol in this area form part of the basis for the commission communication to the council and the european parliament on the mid-term evaluation of the eu action plan on drugs .
this mid-term evaluation was a first step in a larger process .
by the end of this year we will have the final evaluation .
without wanting to pre-empt the results of the final evaluation , the following developments on the eu drugs market can already be observed .
heroin seizures have increased since 0000 .
our assessment is that street prices are generally stable or even decreasing .
the number of heroin addicts seems to be relatively stable in the european union , although there are marked differences between the member states .
cannabis remains the most widely-used illicit drug and its use is still increasing in many member states .
the use of synthetic drugs such as ecstasy and the use of cocaine seem to be increasing in certain population groups , although the use of these drugs among the general population remains low .
thank you , commissioner , for a helpful and very informative reply .
i do not think any blame for the problem lies with you because you do not have many battalions at your disposal !
you can only set a lead .
the price of heroin going down would suggest that the supply of heroin is increasing .
we know that the crop in afghanistan is getting bigger and bigger , and with the use of cannabis and synthetic drugs ever growing , clearly we are not winning the battle .
so my question is : how can we strengthen policing in europe in the fight against the use and the distribution of drugs ?
. thank you for recognising that to a certain extent i am like the pope : i have no legions at all !
indeed you are right , mr newton dunn , the main responsibility in this area lies with the member states .
but there is a lot we can do , both in internal policy and external policy .
when it comes to internal policy , one has to recognise that for years now europol has been playing a very important coordinating role in detecting the main transit routes .
when we have detected the transit routes , we try to cooperate with such countries in order to prevent the entry into the european union of those drugs .
we have made some progress in the balkan region thanks to cooperation with the countries in the area .
thanks to the support of the cards programme , we have been developing specific law enforcement capabilities in those countries to fight against drug trafficking .
i am less positive in my assessment as regards afghanistan .
the figures i have at my disposal demonstrate that the poppies are growing and increasing , and it is quite clear that in afghanistan the political situation is not stable enough to guarantee close cooperation as far as law enforcement is concerned in order to tackle the issue of drugs trafficking .
i believe this issue – and i know my colleague commissioner patten shares this view – will be at the top of the agenda in our negotiations with the afghan authorities in the near future .
mr president , i wish to address a number of subjects i think are related to the drugs issue .
one concerns the lisbon strategy .
how does the commissioner view increased drug use and increased drug misuse in the eu in the light of the fact that , by 0000 , the eu is supposed to have the strongest economy in the world , with the highest growth and an ecologically sustainable economy ?
is it , as it were , good for the labour market that ever more people are giving themselves over to drug misuse ?
i also wish to put a follow-up question concerning the projected european corps of border guards .
what would be its role when it comes to seizing drugs ?
. thank you for raising that question .
my answer is very clear : no , it is not good at all .
firstly , it is not good for people to become addicted to drugs .
the european monitoring centre in lisbon is developing five key indicators that will allow us to have more reliable data , so that we can compare that data among the member states and establish a clearer link between the policy line of member states and the impact of that policy line on the pattern of consumption .
these five indicators refer to figures for drugs used among the general population , the problem of drug use connected with infectious diseases , drugs-related deaths and the treatment provided by member states for those who ask to be treated for drug addiction .
i hope that the work in progress with these five indicators will give us a clearer picture of the situation in europe .
i would just add that my concern today is , above all , the proliferation in the use of synthetic drugs and the upsurge of a new profile of drug addict : the <unk> consumer .
<unk> is a new pattern ; it comes from a combination of illicit drugs and licit drugs .
we need more research and more reliable information in order to be able to fight against this new profile that has arisen in the last few years .
we shall proceed to the second part of this question time , during which commissioner barnier will reply .
biological purification plants have been constructed in many towns in greece using structural fund resources .
it is reported that 000 of the 000 biological purification plants built are only partly operational or have been abandoned .
will the commission say how many of the biological purification plants funded by the structural funds so far are fully operational and how many have operating problems and for which reasons ?
what does it intend to do to ensure that the biological purification plants which have received substantial community funding are fully operational and continue to operate ?
– mr president , mr alavanos asks an important question on a subject that has , moreover , always been of interest to me because , as he knows , i was minister for the environment in my own country and , as you will see from our proposals for the future cohesion policy that we will be tabling next week , i continue to attach great importance to environmental issues .
his question concerns the operation of treatment plants in greece .
according to my information , 000 treatment plants have now been constructed in greece , although 000 would need to be built to meet the needs of all of the greek municipalities .
most of the treatment plants that have already been built were completed thanks to community cofinancing , either from the cohesion fund or from the erdf , under integrated mediterranean programmes , successive community support frameworks or community initiatives .
according to the legislation in force for the erdf and the cohesion fund , the greek authorities have to declare that these plants are operational when they submit each final report marking the end of the subsidy .
however , this same legislation does not give the commission the power to check itself , after the closure of the programmes or projects , that the cofinanced infrastructure is being properly used and maintained .
this task , which is very important and which almost , in my opinion , goes without saying , is the responsibility of the member states .
nevertheless , there is a provision that i can mention today , article 00 of the council directive of 00 may 0000 concerning urban waste water treatment , that provides that member states shall ensure , and i quote , that , ‘ the … treatment plants are … operated and maintained to ensure sufficient performance under all normal local climatic conditions ’ .
article 00 ( 0 ) of the same directive authorises the commission to request information on the functioning of all treatment plants that have been built with help from the structural funds .
i can tell mr alavanos that this is what we intend to do .
if anything is amiss then the commission will take the necessary steps , including possibly initiating an infringement procedure , to ensure that community legislation is properly applied .
exceptionally , and in particular if treatment plants have been abandoned , the commission will consider recovering the funds in accordance with current legislation .
that is the useful and i think precise information that i wanted to give mr alavanos .
commissioner , i thank you on behalf of my honourable friend , mr alavanos .
i too am extremely interested in this question .
if i understood correctly , and i should like you to confirm this , so far the commission has not carried out any inspection based on this article , which gives it the facility to check if these biological purification plants are operational .
because i should like to repeat what is said in the question , and i know this from my own experience from travelling round greece , that most biological plants are either not operational or operate <unk> or operate from time to time .
this is a very important matter .
complaints have also been sent to the commission and reports have been sent to the european parliament .
when do you intend to conduct these inspections ?
you said that you would conduct them .
when do you intend to conduct them ?
. – the commission ’s role is to ensure that the member states – in this case , greece – meet their obligations .
in addition , i should like to tell you , following on from my first answer , that we have been informed that greece has recently set up a body of environmental inspectors . one of this body ’s tasks should be to inspect all of the plants that you and mr alavanos mentioned .
in any case , the commission does not have a mandate to carry out inspections itself for and on behalf of the member state concerned ; subsidiarity applies here , i believe .
nevertheless , as i mentioned myself in my first answer , we are able , in accordance with the council directive concerning urban waste water treatment – we have the authority , if i may say so – to request information on the operation of all treatment plants .
encouraged by mr alavanos ’s question , i can confirm that i will be doing this in the course of the next few weeks .
at the end of december 0000 , the spanish government submitted an application for funding for the project to divert water from the river ebro to spain 's eastern seaboard .
is the commission aware that on 00 january 0000 , <unk> rodriguez , the spanish minister for the environment , announced that work on the project would begin in february 0000 ?
what is the commission 's opinion on that decision and what stance will it adopt with respect to it , bearing in mind that it has not taken any decision as regards the viability of the project ?
. – mr president , mr ferrández lezaun ’s question reminds me of the debate that we had recently with mrs wallström in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy on this major dossier of the ebro .
the spanish authorities have requested community financing from the cohesion fund and the structural funds for the project to divert water from the river ebro .
the eligibility dates of the expenditure for the various <unk> are 00 december 0000 and 0 january 0000 respectively .
the spanish authorities do not therefore need to wait for the commission to give its decision before starting these projects , given that beginning the work will in no way prejudice the commission ’s decision on whether to grant community financing .
in other words , it is one thing to start the project and it is quite another to receive confirmation of community financing .
if , then , after investigating this project as part of an overall process of reflection on the ebro – as i said the other day before the committee on the environment – the commission were to decide not to support particular parts of the overall project , the member state alone would have to bear the cost of the expenditure incurred .
that is my answer to the question .
commissioner , i am sorry to return to this issue which is constantly being repeated , but there is currently enormous confusion in spain .
in this case , however , we return to the same problem .
you are aware of the serious problems in spain of a social and , possibly , environmental nature .
what would happen if , once the work is finished , you , without considering economic factors or funds , simply do not comply with european legislation ?
what will we do in that case ?
put all the work back to its original state , with all the expense that that would entail ?
we would therefore like to ask you whether you believe it makes more sense for the commission to ask the spanish government to suspend any actions relating to the spanish national hydrological plan , in a precautionary fashion , until the commission has taken a decision ?
. – mr ferrández lezaun , i quite understand your impatience and your concern to have this clarified .
we had a fairly frank and constructive debate on this matter the other day in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy and , with mrs wallström ’s agreement , i gave a fairly resolute answer .
in my own view , even though , administratively , several different funding sources are involved , indeed several different programmes – regional programmes in andalusia , valencia and murcia , as well as the cohesion fund , which are varied instruments that may all contribute in one way or another to funding the project to divert water from the river ebro – this is one single project and its strategic importance is such as to warrant being examined as a whole by the commission .
this is , i think , a clear answer and is along the lines that you wanted .
once again , we are going to consider any request as part of a comprehensive analysis of the project .
i said just now that there was nothing to stop the spanish authorities from starting work on various parts of the project if they so wished .
these parts of the project will have to be carried out in accordance with the environmental legislation .
we will check that they are , as this is very important . the commission also needs to issue a favourable assessment of the ebro project if community funding is to be authorised .
by starting the work very early , the spanish authorities are taking the responsibility for any appeals to the court of justice for , for example , not respecting current legislation on the environment .
there is also a risk that , since the commission will be making its overall assessment of the ebro project after work has started , the expected funding may not materialise .
legally , that is as much as i can say .
i would simply add that the answer that i gave about the overall assessment that we want to make of the project , which is one single project even though it comprises several parts , is , i think , what you wanted to hear .
i would like to thank the commissioner in particular for the clarity with which he has replied , just as he did at the meeting of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy in response to a similar question from mr ferrández .
i hope that , following this second reply , mr ferrández will be fully aware of how things are proceeding here – of what the commission and the spanish government are really doing : in other words , it should be made very clear that the spanish government is not doing anything illegal by beginning work at certain points of what will be the ebro diversion .
i am particularly grateful to the commissioner for his clarity because ideas are sometimes communicated which lead to confusion amongst the spanish citizens and i hope that all the doubts which mr ferrández is constantly raising have finally been cleared up .
i would remind the honourable members that they take the floor especially to put questions .
since 00 seconds remain , you may ask a question if you wish , mrs avilés .
we would like mr barnier to tell us how long it will take the commission finally to respond to this demand , which is of genuine concern to the spanish people , and in aragón in particular .
. – i do not wish to commit myself by giving you an answer and running the risk of being contradicted later on .
we should actually be aware that this project is complex and that , as is only proper , we need to examine it from the point of view of community legislation on the environment , from the point of view of the rules and , finally , from the point of view of this rather original analysis that we wish to conduct of the entire project .
i think the spanish authorities have finally understood our approach , whereas at the beginning it was more a question of gaining approval on a <unk> basis .
we want to produce an overall assessment of all of the information that is available to us , in particular of the effectiveness of the project and its cost to consumers .
ideally , we would like to be ready to issue this assessment during the course of the summer , at the end of this six-month period .
we have carried out preliminary studies , internal consultations and economic analyses .
the commission ’s assessment will cover all of the technical projects themselves but will also include the economic analysis that will be made of them .
this is , after all , a major ecological project and we are therefore going to proceed responsibly , which should enable us to issue our overall assessment of the ebro water transfer project during the course of the summer .
the mistake proposed by this parliament was made very clear to me at the meeting on the 00th , with commissioner wallström and yourself .
before moving on to the specific subject of mr ferrández ’s question and your reply , i will say that i am from valencia , on the banks of the júcar river , which today is dying as a result of there not having been a rigorous environmental impact study .
we all know that work of this magnitude is irreversible once it is built .
therefore , the socio-economic effects and the destruction and deterioration of the environment would be less harmful if today this parliament were to send a note to the spanish government telling it to suspend the project as a precaution until it is examined by this parliament .
. – we obviously need much more time to debate this subject , which is of great importance to the european parliament and members of all political hues .
mrs <unk> <unk> , in the two cases that i mentioned just now and that were the subject of the question that i was asked , the commission does not have the right to order a preventive suspension of the work .
i am obliged to tell you this .
we have gone quite a long way already in stating that , given the extent of this project and all of the ecological , socioeconomic and technical questions that it raises , we have decided to carry out an overall assessment .
pending the results of this , some of the work can start . it will not be finished by june or july .
be that as it may , during the course of the summer the commission will say : we think that this project is realistic and feasible or that it presents risks or problems .
on this basis decisions will be made , in particular on whether to commit the european funding that has been requested .
that is all that i can say today and i should like to thank you for your views and comments .
one of the main elements involved in creating a european area is cross-border cooperation .
it has often become clear that it is difficult to achieve proper cooperation because of the difficulties inherent in the various laws applicable in neighbouring countries , and also the lack of a community public law instrument which would make such cooperation possible .
will the commission soon be submitting a proposal for a legal framework which will make cross-border cooperation possible between state , regional and local governments within the eu ?
mr president , i am grateful to you for allowing me to reply to mr vallvé , as this question is also important .
like mr vallvé , the commission believes that cross-border cooperation is a key element to european integration .
furthermore , in a different context , namely that of the convention on the future of europe – in which i took part – i have repeatedly proposed that the draft constitution should provide a sound constitutional platform for cooperation of this kind .
in any event , if we are to achieve the harmonious and balanced integration of the entire eu , we must support cooperation , especially cross-border cooperation .
this is precisely what we are doing with the interreg iii community initiative , which contains a strand a specifically dedicated to strengthening cross-border cooperation .
i am also completely aware of the difficulties that authorities at member state , regional and local level have experienced in putting in place interreg cross-border cooperation projects .
these difficulties have mainly to do with the need for partners on either side of a border to respect both national rights and the administrative rules and procedures of their own country .
i say this , mr president , with some degree of experience , as i spent seventeen years as the president of a border region in france , where i was in charge of a large number of projects that encountered the very types of difficulty that i have just mentioned , in my specific case with our counterparts in the valle d'aosta in italy .
we must therefore provide a stable and shared solution to this problem .
the commission has called for a study to catalogue the problems faced by the authorities in charge of these programmes , with some suggestions as to how these problems may be solved .
the results of this study will be made public in the spring , giving the commission time to propose appropriate legislative measures in the framework of the future regulation applicable to the coming structural funds programming period .
this legislative proposal will , i believe , be presented in june .
the members of your house will be aware that the commission is to adopt next week , on 00 february , the third report on economic and social cohesion , which i shall be presenting to this house .
the report will contain proposals for a reformed and strengthened cohesion policy after 0000 .
the creation of a legal framework for cross-border cooperation , which mr vallvé so fervently wishes to see , must form part of the proposals that the commission will support in its third report on cohesion .
– mr president , commissioner , i shall reply in your language .
i should like to thank you for your intervention and to say that i hope that we shall have the opportunity to hear you when you present your report on cohesion , which will not only be about social and economic cohesion , but will now , for the first time , also encompass territorial cohesion .
i also believe that territorial cohesion will not be possible without a genuine instrument to strengthen cross-border cooperation .
it is clear that the cities and the regions , or in france ’s case the , have had difficulty in setting up cross-border cooperation programmes , given the differences in legislation that exist between the countries concerned .
i therefore feel that it is at european level that we have to design an instrument that makes such cooperation both possible and , hopefully , easy .
we await a legislative proposal in this regard , which will contribute towards reinforcing the links between the different countries , in order to dismantle what remains of these borders , described by robert schuman as scars of europe ’s history .
. mr vallvé , rather than asking me a question , you gave me encouragement .
you will not have long to wait , since , as i said , i shall be presenting the report on cohesion next wednesday with mrs diamantopoulou and mr fischler .
i also hope that we will be in a position to do this right here or in brussels during an enlarged conference of presidents , but i am not sure of this yet .
what i can tell you , mr vallvé , is that in this report we move in the direction that you wish .
i will be going into precise detail , as i have done in the report on cohesion ; having worked a great deal with my services and the legal services of the commission , and having enjoyed your support , i hope that in the legislative programme setting out the regulations for future cohesion policy , i will be able to fulfil your wishes by proposing what may be a kind of cross-border authority .
these are the directions in which we are moving .
in fact , mr barnier was right to say that there was no explicit question ; i thought it could be understood as a question , but in any event a bit of help never does any harm .
that is why this dialogue is always positive .
mr ortuondo larrea has a supplementary question .
commissioner , as you will be aware , there is a priority project , one of those approved at the essen council , on the trans-european networks , relating to the high-speed <unk> rail connection , and one branch of this project is intended to link the french city of dax with vitoria : dax in the region of aquitaine and vitoria in the autonomous community of the basque country .
both the region of aquitaine and the autonomous community of the basque country wish to promote this project and face difficulties in terms of understanding and application on the part of the respective central governments of the french and spanish states .
these two regions wish to move it ahead and i am trying to ensure that within the european union this cross-border cooperation can be accepted .
i would therefore ask you the following specific question : is this instrument , which you have told us we may possibly have after the summer , going to relate just to european regional policy funds or can it also be extended to european funds for trans-european transport networks and any other type of actions with community resources ?
. firstly , mr larrea , regional funds and structural funds have been used to finance transport networks .
cohesion funds , and possibly funds from erdf objective 0 , have intervened , are currently intervening and will continue to intervene on certain strategic sections to finance transport networks of various types , and in particular cross-border transport networks .
i am broadly in favour and moving in the direction that you wish .
it strikes me that this new instrument on which we are working may serve to mobilise and make use of european funds , and even if european funds are lacking , i shall admit to you that my dream would be that we might propose the status of cross-border territorial authority , which would be created and which would have access to local , national or regional funds .
it goes without saying that , even though such a status would be feasible without european funds , it would be even more so with them .
i need a little more time , but i should like to make an announcement in this regard next week , probably in the cohesion report .
i shall moreover spend a little more time on the legislative instrument , although i shall bear your suggestion in mind .
thank you very much for your cooperation , mr barnier .
in accordance with the rules of procedure , questions nos 00 to 00 will be replied to in writing ( 0 ) .
we will begin with the 00 minutes for mr liikanen .
the world summit on the information society was announced as a major step forward regarding citizen participation .
in one of the eu <unk> ( wsis <unk> document <unk> ) , the summit itself is seen as a model for the future role of civil society .
after the geneva summit , the disappointment of civil society actors can hardly be underestimated .
in their ' civil society declaration to the wsis ' entitled ' shaping information societies for human needs ' , civil society representatives agreed unanimously upon the following statement : ' at this step of the process , the first phase of the summit , geneva , december 0000 , our voices and the general interest we collectively expressed are not adequately reflected in the summit documents ' .
does the commission see the participation of civil society at the wsis as a failure , does it recognise the need to stimulate and increase civil society participation in the next phases of the wsis and , if so , what initiatives will it take to stimulate an increase in civil society participation in the next phase of the wsis ?
. civil society participated in the world summit on the information society preparatory process and in the summit itself , according to the rules of procedure .
this is largely the result of the european union 's efforts during the preparatory committees .
moreover , the summit 's executive secretariat set up a civil society bureau organising 00 families in order to facilitate the participation of various civil society constituencies .
it even held formal meetings with civil society representatives in geneva on various occasions .
it has allowed a broad convergence on key themes such as human rights , freedom of access to and communication of information , media or gender issues .
i personally participated in a number of those .
civil society adopted a declaration on the information society , which is available on the official summit website .
although the commission has received rather positive feedback , some civil society representatives could estimate that their views have not been fully taken into account in the final documents adopted by the summit .
even if the proposals of civil society were not fully taken on board in the final documents , the commission is convinced that they have played an influential role .
as was also pointed out by the conference of non-governmental organisations in consultative relations with the united nations , some common language is emerging between governments and civil society representatives , paving the way for a better understanding and cooperation in the future .
nevertheless , we must remember that the world summit on the information society remains an intergovernmental process under united nations rules , benefiting from the united nations ' legitimacy and united nations principles of representation .
in its upcoming communication to the council and parliament , the commission intends to propose to convey to the summit 's executive secretariat a clear message in favour of a stronger role for civil society and to relay that position in its participation in the conference bureau as well as in its contributions .
– mr president , i would like to thank the commissioner for his very detailed response .
although i gather that he very much appreciates the input of non-governmental organisations , i notice in my dealings with those organisations that there is still some doubt as to their actual influence .
i note what the commissioner is now stating in this connection .
the preparations for the 0000 tunis summit are fully underway .
i should like to invite the commissioner to continue his dialogue with the non-governmental organisations .
as the commissioner is aware , we in the european parliament have a meeting planned with a number of organisations as early as the beginning of march .
he has been invited to this but is , unfortunately , unable to attend in person .
i should like to invite his cabinet , or members of his cabinet , or of his staff , to attend this meeting , which will be held in this house on 0 march .
i would remind the honourable members that speaking time is for asking questions , not for making statements .
mr harbour has a supplementary question .
i would like to ask the commissioner a supplementary question as an mep who actually attended the summit in geneva and was therefore able to see the extensive engagement on the floor of the conference by members of civil society , which i thought was very helpful .
i would also welcome an invitation to mr staes ' meeting .
although i went to the summit , i was entirely unaware of his interest , so maybe we could get together later .
one of the points i made when we had a debate on this issue , commissioner , was that i felt that parliamentarians need to be much better engaged in the process .
we only had a small meeting with the interparliamentary union .
would he work with the european parliament so that we can get a better engagement , both of european and national parliamentarians , as part of the tunis agenda and in the run-up to tunis ?
firstly , i thank mr harbour for his active participation in the world summit and also the participation of the other members of the european parliament .
it was very helpful and supportive .
i am ready to look for all possible ways to improve our cooperation in an informal context and also in the preparation for the tunis summit in 0000 .
i should like to say to mr staes that whenever i receive an invitation to the european parliament i always come , if possible .
in finland , to name just that example , only a fraction of public sector web pages are currently accessible without difficulty to the disabled and elderly .
it can probably be assumed that things are not much better in other member states .
this situation is very worrying from the point of view of the digital divide , which the union is endeavouring to combat , at any rate in its documents .
could the commission draw up a union-wide programme whereby providers of public services would be obliged to use technologies already available at present so as to enable the visually impaired , say , to benefit from the same services as the able-bodied population ?
. mr president , the commission shares mr paasilinna ’s concern that in europe the number of public sector websites that are currently accessible without difficulty is too limited .
after the eeurope action plan adopted in 0000 the commission recommended in its communication that all public websites should follow the web content accessibility guidelines developed in the world wide web consortium ’s web accessibility initiative .
parliament took a positive view of this , as is evident from bastiaan belder ’s report and the resolution taken on it .
in resolutions by the council and parliament the commission was asked to monitor progress in order to obtain comparable data .
the commission has followed these recommendations and in the next few weeks will publish a report explaining what has been achieved .
the member states and the institutions of the eu are revising systems so that they harmonise with the guidelines .
this has mainly been agreed within the context of voluntary eeurope cooperation .
it has nevertheless to be borne in mind that unhindered access to public sector websites will be a long process , as there are a lot of them .
it is also to be hoped that organisations for people with disabilities will be actively involved in this .
when the time came for me to give our instructions i received 00 emails on the same day saying that commissioner liikanen ’s website did not meet the agreed conditions .
pressure like this makes it easier to bring about change .
at the same time the commission will naturally look into whether community non-discrimination policy law needs to be expanded in the future .
as a result , this spring the commission is to begin a public hearing on a green paper on future strategy to combat discrimination .
the green paper will map out the community ’s progress in practising a non-discrimination policy and raise questions to do with policy development .
they will include addressing the new challenges that enlargement of the union will bring with it and laying down policy on action to promote equality in the union for the next five years .
– mr president , commissioner , thank you for your reply and i am delighted to hear that so much is going on .
would the green paper also cover the lot of the socially excluded and any programmes or plans for closing the digital divide ?
. – mr president , i shall do my best to see to it that this too is given greater prominence when the matter is being dealt with .
thank you .
the european agency for network and information security ( it agency ) is reportedly to be located on crete , a good two hours from the nearest airport in a village with no broadband facility .
the commission previously gave the impression that a location close to modern communications , infrastructure , research and an it industry would be best for the agency and the work it is being set up to do .
in the light of this information , does the commission consider it the optimal situation for the council to be able to take decisions concerning the location of agencies and authorities behind closed doors ?
should such decisions not be taken with greater openness so that the factual arguments in favour of the location can be given greater weight ?
does the commission consider that the location of the it agency may have a detrimental effect on its work ?
will the agency be able to carry out its work in accordance with the regulation ?
furthermore , does the commission consider that it would be more cost-effective and efficient if eu agencies and authorities came under the commission for administrative purposes ?
the member states ' requirement of one representative per country is in danger of creating ineffective decision-making forums .
should expertise not weigh more heavily in the balance than national interests in such contexts so that industry and consumer organisations get better representation ?
is the commission satisfied with the current situation in which countries without railways are represented on the railway agency and countries without sea are represented on the maritime safety agency ?
. on 00 december , the representatives of the member states , meeting at head of state or government level , decided by common agreement on the seat of certain offices and agencies of the european union and , in that context , a decision was taken that the ' european network and information security agency ( enisa ) shall have its seat in greece , in a location to be determined by the greek government . '
due to its specific nature , the commission considers that the agency ’s basic requirements include advanced and highly secure information technology equipment , support and operations , sufficiently protected against hacking and security attacks , of which it will certainly be a target .
this includes the equipment underpinning normal office tasks , as well as the agency 's intranet and databases used to store data necessary to the work of the agency , or <unk> applications and networks required for interaction with any national administrations .
furthermore , making information available both to the general public , as well as to the specialised audiences will require a properly designed , hosted , operated and protected website .
the very recent malicious code attacks have yet again proven the need for increased coordination between member states to achieve higher levels of security .
the commission is convinced that the setting-up of enisa , with its own legal personality , is the most efficient way to achieve this objective .
it favours trust and consequently the direct involvement of industry in its work .
this involvement is seen as crucial to solving the information security problems in europe .
i am pleased to assure you that the commission is committed to launching enisa ’s operational activities as soon as possible .
concerning the honourable member ’s questions on the composition and participation of the management board , the commission , in line with its communication of december 0000 on the operating framework for the european regulatory agencies , generally favours a small-scale management board .
i made this clear in a statement during the council on 00 november 0000 .
however , because of the specific tasks assigned to enisa and the pressing need for its establishment , the commission has not stood in the way of a first-reading agreement between the legislators .
the commission has nevertheless pointed out the exceptional nature of the course taken and reaffirms its eagerness to see the general framework applied .
thank you very much , commissioner liikanen , for an absolutely excellent reply .
everyone who has followed this matter and has heard the demands we have made of the it agency perhaps has difficulty appreciating that those demands related directly to crete .
we are concerned that the agency may be ineffective .
parliament will therefore , of course , apply pressure in this area .
we are totally convinced that the commission can also help us minimise the negative effects of locating the agency in crete , which i do not regard as the ideal location .
the council is unfortunately defending incomprehensible positions , for example that such decisions should be made without public scrutiny .
to be honest , that is incomprehensible , given the legislation on transparency we have elsewhere .
i shall conclude by putting a question , not because i cannot work out what the commissioner thinks but because i want a clear answer , which i intend to use in the election campaign in relation to the governments .
might the it agency be more effective with a smaller management or perhaps with a system of rotation ?
how important is it that the institutions use tax revenue efficiently and thriftily , and how might we bring this about ?
mr president , i agree that we should use tax revenue efficiently .
that is the first answer .
the second answer is that the member states usually want to exert influence upon the day-to-day activities of any strong institution they create . they all wish to be able to send a representative to the board of management .
i have already expressed my view in this house .
the choice is between adopting a rapid solution during this parliament ’s and this commission ’s terms of office or of waiting for a more uncertain future to arrive .
i chose the more rapid solution , because all the current crises concerning network security have shown that we must take prompt measures .
we shall take the last question from commissioner liikanen .
more than 00 000 people die and 0.0 million are injured every year in the eu in road accidents .
this situation is unacceptable .
road safety can be improved by building safer vehicles which also operate more safely .
information technology can be used to achieve that goal .
can the commission say what stage has been reached with the <unk> programme and what progress has been made in that programme to improve road safety in europe ?
. let me first welcome the consistent activity of mrs hedkvist petersen on the issue of road safety , including esafety .
she has a real case here , because the number of road accident fatalities in the current european union of 00 member states was about 00 000 per year in 0000 .
this figure is unacceptably high and , therefore , we have the ambitious target to halve this number by 0000 .
a wide range of actions are being taken by the eu and the member states to make this target a reality , with the result that , according to preliminary data , the number of persons killed on europe ’s roads last year amounted to about 00 000 persons .
the commission has recognised the great potential of the new information and communication technologies in saving lives by mitigating the consequences of accidents or even completely avoiding them .
in september last year the commission adopted a communication entitled ' information and communications technologies for safe and intelligent vehicles ' .
it proposes 00 measures that promote the rapid development and deployment of new active safety systems in europe .
the work in realising the actions proposed by the communication is under way .
we have established , together with the industry , member states , stakeholders and members of parliament , the ' esafety forum ' .
under the forum seven working groups are active on priority esafety topics .
the first results are available in the 0000 summary report , which is available on our esafety website .
we would very much welcome the opinion of the european parliament , as well as a commitment from member states .
the commission is also considering mandating the installation in commercial vehicles of electronic systems whose effectiveness has been proven in practice , such as electronic stability systems for buses and heavy goods vehicles .
furthermore , the commission is using the sixth framework programme to develop further the technologies for in-vehicle active safety systems .
an integrated project , ' prevent ' – which has over 00 partners and an overall budget of eur 00 million , with about eur 00 million of community funding – is the most important project in this area .
thank you very much , mr liikanen , for an absolutely excellent and very interesting answer .
we see that a very great deal indeed is happening in this area .
in the future eu , that is to say an eu with 00 member states , upwards of 00 000 people will die each year on our roads .
that is equivalent to a medium-sized swedish town being wiped out every year .
we cannot go on like this .
we have high hopes of it technology and the esafety programme .
it is a very important piece of work that is going on , and it appears to be at an advanced stage .
i also hope that parliament will express its opinion on the report mentioned by mr liikanen .
the industry has made great progress , but there are big differences between one eu country and another in terms of it sophistication .
applications such as these require installations both in cars and in the environment .
i should like to hear commissioner liikanen ’s assessment of progress in the various member states and also in the candidate countries .
mr president , the issue addressed by mrs hedkvist petersen is a very major one , namely that of our in actual fact needing cooperation between different sectors .
we need not only safe cars , but also different types of infrastructure that operate together .
we have made certain progress in cooperation , for example the common telephone number 000 , which makes things easier in the event of road accidents .
it is quite clear that , in this area , we need more pressure from above to organise the cooperation between industry , infrastructure authorities and insurance companies .
we hope that the work on esafety will be of help , and perhaps we could also get the member states to devote more attention to this sector .
in our first action programme , eeurope 0000 , we had a special approach to <unk> , but it was not , unfortunately , able to create sufficient interest among the member states .
one positive thing is that , last autumn , we had a big world conference in madrid with approximately 0 000 participants . the member states too showed more interest on that occasion .
the hungarian government issued invitations to an esafety conference in budapest in may 0000 where we hope for participation not only from it ministers but also from transport ministers and the authorities responsible for transport infrastructure .
if technology and infrastructure are not coordinated , we shall not be able to obtain any practical results .
i also thank the commissioner and his services for what is an outstanding programme – the esafety programme .
i have been privileged to participate in a number of the high-level working meetings .
i would like to ask two questions specifically , to add to what he has told us already .
the first relates to his views about the likely development of the ecall technology , which will give automatic location of a vehicle after an accident .
this seems to me to be one of the most important proposals on the table and the one that is the most feasible .
it also builds on our work in mobile telephony .
secondly , i want to ask for the commissioner 's assurance that his services will consider sympathetically , in looking at the phase 0 standards for pedestrian protection , the major contribution that accident avoidance technologies will make in that improvement in reducing pedestrian casualties .
i have just seen results from german tests which indicate that the phase 0 structural standards may not bring about the sort of improvements that we had been expecting .
. in reply to the honourable member , let me say that , regarding the first issue of ecall technologies , we have now seen the first real applications in the marketplace , and they work .
at the madrid conference we looked at applications developed by the health authorities and car industry , which showed that , when an accident took place , direct contact could be established with the hospital and the ambulance services were able to locate the place of the accident and make direct telephone contact .
in technological terms the product is now ready .
the challenge now is to implement it appropriately .
but the first issue has been solved .
on the second matter , as far as <unk> measures by it tools are concerned , progress has been made on the research side based essentially on the use of <unk> or sensors , which help the driver to identify potential risks in traffic , especially during the early evening , often the most dangerous time .
we will look at the issue in detail in the context of the feasibility studies to be carried out .
as we all know , accident prevention is by far the best solution .
in any case , pedestrian safety is a priority for all of us and we will stick to the commitments we have made .
thank you very much for your replies , mr liikanen .
in accordance with the rules of procedure , questions nos 00 and 00 will be replied to in writing ( 0 ) .
we shall proceed to today ’s final section : 00 minutes of questions to commissioner verheugen .
on 00 december 0000 the hungarian parliament passed a government bill that restricts the ability of the hungarian financial supervisory authority ( <unk> ) to act freely when carrying out its statutory tasks .
at the same time , action is being taken to intervene in an ongoing court case that could bring politically inconvenient facts to light .
commissioner bolkestein has previously made clear in a letter what standards are to be imposed on a financial watchdog .
the european central bank , like meps , has criticised the planned amendments to the law .
does the commission consider , particularly with the correct use of european funds in mind , that an independent financial regulatory authority is still in place ?
if so , why ?
if not , what steps does it intend to take to safeguard the financial interests of the eu ?
. mr gahler , this has been a familiar issue for some time .
i would remind you , first of all , that the bill adopted by the hungarian parliament on 00 december 0000 regulates the relations between the hungarian financial supervisory authority ( <unk> ) , the hungarian parliament and the ministry of finance .
the text of this bill is available to the commission .
it states that the hungarian financial supervisory authority may not accept any instructions in the performance of its tasks , which are set out in the bill .
nonetheless , the ministry of finance does have the right to be informed on a regular basis about the activities of the authority and may call on the authority to cease any improper practices if shortcomings do arise .
in terms of evaluating these two aspects of the bill , i should point out that the explicit provision stating that the authority may not accept any instructions in the performance of its legally defined tasks , but that the finance minister has the right to be informed about its activities , is in line with normal standards , including those in place in the member states of the european union .
quite apart from this , the commission has been informed that the bill has not come into force .
the hungarian president refused to sign it , referring it instead to the hungarian constitutional court for review .
this review is not yet complete .
the need for further amendments cannot be ruled out .
since the bill has not yet come into force , the hungarian financial supervisory authority is still operating under the existing regulations and the same administrative council .
the commission considers this an important matter .
it is in constant contact with the hungarian government on this issue , and given the importance of efficient and proper financial supervision , has requested the hungarian government to inform it promptly of all developments in this field .
one further question : do you not think it is rather unusual that through this amendment to a bill , there has been intervention in a current procedure ?
furthermore , even if the outcome is supposedly a european standard , what was the legal position before ?
has the authority ’s independence been enhanced , in the commission ’s view , or has it been restricted instead ?
. mr gahler , i do not think it is the commission ’s task to give its views on why a future member state deems it necessary to undertake legislative amendments .
it is our task to be vigilant in ensuring that the legal provisions in the member states are in line with the acquis .
that is what we have done .
how does the commission assess the law on restitution in romania , particularly as regards the german minority , and could this model also be transferred to other candidate countries ?
. mr posselt , the regular assessment report on the progress made by romania , which was published in late 0000 , contains a thorough assessment of romania ’s progress in the restitution of assets .
in the general conclusions it is stated that the legal framework for restitution is now fully functional .
there is one notable exception : restitutions of churches .
this is an incredibly sensitive issue in romania .
the sensitive nature of the problem , together with the problems within and between certain denominations has resulted in a blocking of the planned legislation .
the law in romania applies equally to all romanian citizens .
the commission is not aware of any special provisions for the german minority .
your question , mr posselt , indicates that you may be better informed than the commission .
if there is something the commission does not know about , i would be grateful if you could let me know .
consequently , i am unable to answer your question as to whether this model could be transferred to other candidate countries .
it is hard for me to assess a law we do not know about .
the selection of the general model for asset restitutions in romania is a sovereign matter for romania , and the sole responsibility of that state .
as you know , the european union has no legal authority in this area .
nevertheless , the regular commission report does highlight the fact that the progress made in actual restitutions varies greatly depending on the value of the assets to be returned .
there has been real progress in restitutions of agricultural and forested land , but the transfer of buildings has only just started .
only 0 % of the properties in question had been returned by the end of 0000 .
i would classify that as fairly slow implementation of the relevant legislation .
– commissioner , firstly i do believe that it is the commission ’s role – and one you fully appreciate – to ensure that the relevant legislation is actually enforced . in essence , that justice and administration in the candidate countries really do work within a reasonable time .
this is why you were right to address the 0 % question .
secondly , i believe – during the previous question time , you did state that you are still responsible for minority issues , including in candidate countries – that the romanian and hungarian legislation seeks to treat all citizens equally .
you know that there have been considerable problems with the czech legislation , for which there is of course an official explanation .
announcements were made by mr <unk> and others regarding initiatives intended to improve the situation .
do you know whether anything is being done ?
are there perhaps plans to apply these models , or at least to make another move towards reconciliation ?
there was a lot of talk nine months ago but since then no more has been heard .
. mr posselt , i apologise .
i came prepared for questions on romania .
i am not prepared for incredibly tricky technical questions about the czech republic .
i will ask my services to investigate the matter thoroughly and to contact the relevant czech authorities , and i will give you an answer in writing .
on 00 march 0000 , the constitutional court of malta , at the request of an injured party , gave a definition of ' residence ' ( the <unk> case , judge <unk> <unk> , case no <unk> : harry <unk> <unk> the electoral commission and john mary <unk> ) .
the definition given by the malta constitutional court reads : ‘ the word ' residence ' does not mean physical presence in the country ’ .
moreover , the new law on european elections in malta , ( act no xvi of 0000 , published in the malta government gazette of 00 november 0000 ) explicitly states that all maltese citizens living in the 00 eu countries have a right to vote and stand for election in malta .
is the commission aware of the fact that , despite the constitutional definition and the existing legislation on european elections , the malta labour party has again applied to have 0 000 maltese citizens struck off the electoral register ?
these court cases will begin to be heard by the maltese courts in the last week of january , and maltese employees with the eu institutions are amongst those being targeted .
what does the commission intend to do against this illegal attempt by the <unk> to prevent maltese citizens taking part in these upcoming european elections in malta ?
. mrs schroedter , in the maltese constitution all fundamental rights and citizen ’s rights are recognised .
the right of maltese citizens to vote in general elections depends on their nationality , age , and place of residence .
a short while ago , a maltese citizen lodged a complaint because one party was disputing his right to vote , and the constitutional court found that these requirements do not violate the fundamental rights of maltese citizens .
the european commission has nothing to add to the maltese constitutional court ’s decision .
i would , however , point out that , according to the maltese constitutional court ’s definition , the notion of residence does not require a physical presence in the country , and in fact temporary absences from the country are both included and permitted .
if a political party in malta disputes a citizen ’s right to vote , the relevant maltese court has to consider the case and the ruling of the maltese constitutional court has to be taken into account .
the right to question the electoral roll and election results is an integral part of all transparent democratic systems .
it is certainly not the commission ’s place to intervene in the operation of the maltese legal system .
the commission would also remind you that the recently adopted law on the european elections in malta states that all maltese citizens living in any of the 00 member states have an active and passive right to vote in the elections for the european parliament in malta .
this was possible because the maltese constitution covers general elections , but not european elections .
this is an interesting development , and the commission has taken good note .
it shows that malta ’s increased participation in international organisations is having a very constructive influence on domestic developments .
– mr president , commissioner , you have not addressed the real question , namely the request from the maltese labour party to strike 0 000 citizens off the electoral register for the european elections because they currently live in the european union , and do not work in malta .
this is the heart of the matter , and you have not addressed this in any way .
we are talking about the european elections .
that is the issue at stake , and yet the same thing happens every time .
once again , in this case , 0 000 citizens will be struck off the electoral register .
my question related to this particular case .
please could you give a more detailed response ?
c i will , mrs schroedter , although very reluctantly , because the european commission really has no say in what any political party in malta does or does not do .
you are wrong to say that anyone is being struck off the electoral register .
in this case , a party has used its right to apply for names to be struck off .
this is possible under maltese law , as i explained , and the decision is taken using an objective legal procedure .
as i see it , it is none of our business whether the maltese system is particularly pleasant .
what is important is establishing whether or not the general free and equal voting rights are guaranteed in malta .
they are .
it is certainly not the commission ’s place , however , to pass judgment on the actions of each and every party and i am not going to do so .
will the commission comment on the absence of action in relation to the legal agreements signed by turkey for the <unk> pipeline and turkey 's accession agreements , in the context of its most recent review and despite assurances given ?
will the commission confirm that a number of non-governmental organisations have lodged an application at the european court of justice against the commission 's failure to act , and what preliminary comment will the commission make in response to this application ?
. mr howitt , to clarify the situation in which we currently find ourselves , let me start by pointing out that turkey is not a member of the european union and that we have not even begun accession negotiations with turkey .
this means we have very little opportunity for influencing turkey , particularly via legal instruments .
for this reason , i would refer you to my earlier response to the question from baroness ludford , mrs lambert and you on the same subject and repeat that any negative consequences of the <unk> pipeline agreement signed by turkey or the implementation of that agreement will be assessed according to the copenhagen political criteria .
that is all the commission can do in this case .
our role is to assess whether turkey has met the political criteria necessary for beginning accession talks .
obviously , this will also include assessing whether or not turkey is fully respecting human rights .
the commission report to be presented in autumn this year will examine this question , of course .
the commission is aware that a number of non-governmental organisations filed complaints with the court of first instance in january 0000 .
the commission has not yet been officially notified of the details of these complaints .
if asked to do so by the court , the commission will submit its comments in line with the relevant procedures .
i thank the commissioner for his statement .
although there is only a pre-accession agreement with turkey , he can be assured that the european parliament is fully aware of turkey 's candidate or non-candidate status and that this has some legal impact .
i was one of a number of members who petitioned the commissioner to include an assessment in his last report , last november , on this specific issue .
this did not happen , so i very much hope that an in-depth analysis of the human rights , environmental and other impacts of this pipeline will form part of the assessment this year .
could the commissioner help all of us by saying what mechanisms , approach and analysis he is going to take to investigate this ?
what will he be doing between now and november to answer the questions , so that we can be assured his report is full and fair ?
. mr howitt , i can promise you that in the final and conclusive report on whether turkey meets the political pre-accession requirements we will carefully consider this matter .
the commission will investigate this question , as it has investigated all other human rights issues in turkey .
the commission will draw together all information available from its own sources , from member states , from human rights organisations and international monitoring bodies and also from all public information sources .
obviously , the commission will also ask all those involved to provide relevant information , and will then assess all the data it has gathered .
if necessary , missions will be sent out to get a first-hand impression of the situation on the ground .
we attach a great deal of importance to ensuring that our assessments are based on sound , reliable information , and will ensure that applies here .
does the commission share the view that the <unk> pipeline is a project of great importance both for the future of european energy supplies and for the economic development of turkey and other countries in the region ?
c. to be honest , mr van orden , i have no idea whether the european commission as an institution has a view on this .
however , i can tell you that no attentive newspaper reader can fail to be aware of what is at stake .
i am very happy , therefore , to give you my personal opinion , which is that this is a project of considerable strategic significance , with a huge influence on eastern mediterranean politics , and implications for many other countries , and is therefore a project which merits a great deal of international attention .
thank you very much , mr verheugen , for your cooperation with parliament this evening .
since the time allotted to questions to the commission has elapsed , questions nos 00 to 00 will be replied to in writing ( 0 ) .
that concludes questions to the commission .
the next item is the commission statement on problems with salmon .
. mr president , the study ' global assessment of organic contaminants in farmed salmon ' , published on 0 january 0000 in magazine , compared the levels of 00 <unk> contaminants in samples of farmed and wild salmon .
besides dioxins and pcbs , the study reports on the presence of residues of <unk> pesticides , the use of which has long been prohibited in the eu .
this study does not raise new food safety issues as the levels found are consistent with the results from other surveys and from official controls .
this does not , however , mean that the presence of these contaminants is not a cause for concern .
as regards dioxins , strict eu maximum levels were adopted in 0000 for dioxins in feed and food , including fish .
however , in setting these levels , the commission had to take into account the reality of the current background contamination of the environment in order not to endanger the food supply .
i would remind you that worldwide , only the european union and korea have adopted maximum levels for dioxins in feed and food .
these maximum levels are part of a comprehensive strategy adopted by the european commission in 0000 to reduce the presence of dioxins and pcbs in the environment , in feed and in food .
the implementation of this strategy would give new impetus to the reduction of the background contamination .
as a result , it will be possible to lower progressively the maximum levels to follow this downward trend .
the legislation foresees that , as early as this year , the maximum levels have to be revised to integrate some pcbs with toxicological effects similar to dioxins .
furthermore , it is foreseen that by the end of 0000 the maximum levels will be revised , aiming for a significant reduction .
for the other pcbs , the european food safety authority is currently undertaking a risk assessment .
the result of this risk assessment is expected to become available by the end of 0000 .
the commission will thereafter consider the setting of maximum levels also for these pcbs in feed and food .
the <unk> pesticides detected in the study published in have long been banned in the european union .
however , their continued presence in fish is due to the fact that they are very persistent compounds , which can still be found in the environment .
the european union has established maximum levels for these pesticides in animal feed , including fish feed .
on the basis of updated risk assessments undertaken by the authority , the commission will consider whether a revision of the current levels is necessary for the protection of animal and human health .
the highest levels of two pesticides – <unk> and <unk> – found by the study in salmon feed exceed the maximum levels fixed by the eu .
we have , accordingly , drawn the attention of the member states to these findings and requested that they submit data from official controls and , if necessary , reinforce those controls .
finally , i would stress that the levels of dioxins reported in the study are all below the eu maximum levels .
fish – be it farmed or wild – has its place in a well-balanced diet to ensure that consumers continue to benefit from its positive health effects .
– mr president , commissioner , i was among those members who wanted a debate to be held on this issue , given the alarm that had spread among the public .
immediately after christmas and new year , a number of articles appeared in the french media , mentioning probable dangers .
an announcement was actually made but was not actively followed up , which left consumers with unanswered questions .
i remember some years ago , at least five , possibly six years ago , talking with someone who worked with mr fischler at the commission , who told me , when we were in the midst of the bse crisis , that the second food crisis to hit europe would be in farmed salmon .
those words stayed with me and this is why i was keen for a debate to take place on the matter .
he was certainly exaggerating somewhat – i hope so anyway – and what the commissioner has just told us would appear to bear this out .
nonetheless , i feel that it was important for us to be able to pass on some answers to our fellow citizens so that they know what they have to do .
when we established the european food authority , we emphasised how important it was that communication should be commensurate with the level of risk .
in this regard , when the press articles appeared at the end of 0000 , i would have liked the commission to offer us an immediate response , rather than – somewhat regrettably – waiting until mid-february , when parliament requested the information .
with problems of this nature , it is wrong to focus on the difficulties faced by one economic sector or another .
i put myself in the place of the salmon farmers and of the regions that are – or could have been – affected by information of this kind .
such a situation has economic knock-on effects and we are duty bound to bear this in mind .
our overriding concern , however , is food safety for our fellow citizens .
i therefore believe that it is our duty , and this is especially important , to ensure transparency at all times and to communicate answers at the appropriate moment , so as to avoid a vacuum of information that may increase people ’s concerns .
even so , commissioner , you tell us that the quality of salmon leaves something to be desired , yet you affirm elsewhere that what could be detected as doses of dioxin was below maximum levels set by the eu , and we are all relieved at that .
what i should personally like to request from you is not only that controls be implemented , but also that decisions be taken in order to ensure that farmed fish is better monitored and , more importantly , that it reaches appropriate sanitary levels .
this is what i wanted to say , commissioner , and what we expect from you is that controls should be put in place and swiftly followed by action , so as to offer complete reassurance to european consumers .
mr president , when this debacle began it was with disbelief that many of us watched how a report whose science was questionable could jeopardise one of the most important rural industries in scotland .
scottish salmon farming supports 0 000 jobs , 00 % in the highlands and islands , injecting gbp 0 million every week into the scottish economy .
scottish salmon accounts for nearly 00 % of all scottish food exports .
the bias of the press coverage and the lack of quality information led to a food scare based on insubstantial evidence and falsehood .
i was pleased that the commission took prompt action to put right the evidence and to speak up for the safety of scottish salmon .
so too did the food standards agency in the united kingdom .
the substance of the food scare was based on a highly misleading piece of research published in the american journal pcb and dioxin levels in scottish salmon are significantly lower than the threshold set by the eu , the food standards agency , the us food and drug administration and the world health organisation .
professor hugh <unk> , a leading food expert said : ' the evidence is pretty clear that the officially recommended levels , which are higher than the ones that the scientists are talking about , are actually safe . '
the methodology of this research has been called into question .
the conclusions are based on a controversial risk assessment model that was introduced by the us environmental protection agency .
the risk assessment model is not recognised by international organisations responsible for food safety and public health such as the who , which considers it scientifically flawed .
additionally , the salmon used in the study were purchased prior to the country of origin labelling regulations , and so the study has not even ensured that the salmon tested were farmed in scotland or the eu .
on top of all of this , the research does not contain any new information .
even the figures used in the research are questionable , as they differ from uk government official figures .
with this in mind , the food standards agency does not accept the research findings and advises people to eat two portions of fish per week , with one portion being oily fish , such as salmon .
sadly the american research has ignored all the health benefits of eating salmon , which contains high levels of <unk> fatty acids and is proven to reduce the risk of heart attack .
sir john <unk> , chairman of the fsa , backed this up .
he said that although dioxin levels have decreased dramatically over the past two decades , they remain a consumer concern .
the known benefits of eating one portion of oily fish outweigh any possible risks .
on the subject of fish feed , which was also brought into question , the feed of us , canadian and chilean producers comes from the same sources as that for the scottish fish farmers .
it seems strange that us , canadian and chilean samples should be free from levels of the substances under test , compared with those from scotland .
to my mind there is something very odd going on , when the basis of a report can be taken as read without thorough investigation .
in fact , one of the scientists involved in the research – dr david carpenter – has confessed that ' there may be some legitimacy in saying the reason they chose to fund this study was that they had another agenda well beyond the health effects . '
scottish quality salmon members already undertake measures to ensure the quality of its feed supplies and have in place a testing regime to ensure its standards are met , as well as the rigorous environmental regulation that fish farms adhere to , which has been improving year on year since fish farming began .
the scottish environmental protection agency has a specific remit and responsibility to regulate salmon farming – 00 pieces of legislation , 00 european directives , 0 european regulations , 00 commission decisions – that help reassure consumers that the product they are consuming is of the highest quality .
i do not know if the commission is in a position to comment on the proposed anti-dumping measures .
i understand that there were ongoing negotiations this weekend between the irish presidency and the british government .
if you have an opportunity to comment , commissioner , that may be useful .
a line needs to be drawn under this episode .
damage has been done to the scottish salmon farming industry , there is no doubt about that .
however , we have to move on , highlighting the falsehood of the accusations and the importance of eating salmon as part of a balanced , healthy diet .
it is because of our membership of the eu that we can work together in order to seek solutions .
the european commission 's immediate response reassured consumers that eating salmon is safe .
it is only by action at the eu level that we can take action against false food scares and bring reality to bear .
– mr president , the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party is satisfied with the commission ’s statement .
the health risks associated with salmon have quite obviously been exaggerated .
on the other hand it is obvious that eating farmed salmon is less healthy than eating wild salmon .
this is one reason why the european union should aspire to a policy on salmon that keeps as close to nature as possible , although salmon farms will of course still be needed for the production of both rainbow trout and salmon .
the baltic sea has its own migratory salmon stock .
the rivers flowing into the baltic have produced young that have migrated to feed on what the sea areas have to offer : shrimp and small fish .
contamination and the use of the water systems for floating timber and hydroelectric power production have had an adverse effect on breeding .
this decline has been partially offset by introducing stocks of salmon into rivers , something which companies that produce hydroelectric power in particular have been obliged to do .
that , however , has not had much effect .
it has been estimated that as many as 00 % of young salmon introduced in this way perish .
on the other hand , there has been overfishing of salmon both in the open sea and in coastal waters close to the rivers in which they spawn .
there have been continual disputes over salmon fishing rights .
now that , with enlargement , the baltic sea is to become even more obviously an inland sea of the union , a comprehensive plan should be drawn up to protect salmon stocks and organise fishing activity .
salmon breeding must be restored as closely as possible to its original natural state .
rivers and streams that make good spawning grounds must be made suitable to permit increases in salmon stocks .
<unk> should be built on constructed waterways , and the spawning grounds in the rivers should be properly maintained .
by promoting the natural regeneration of salmon stocks we can open up new opportunities for sport fishing and tourism based on it in all the countries with a baltic coastline .
once the natural reproduction process for salmon is improved , the level of introduced fish stocks can be reduced and in the course of time perhaps abandoned altogether .
the money saved can be spent on the building of <unk> , the upkeep of spawning grounds , and boosting other fish stock levels .
the fishing of baltic salmon should start to see the implementation of the ‘ spawn state principle ’ , which has been successfully applied in the north atlantic within the framework of the north atlantic salmon conservation organisation .
fishing has to be restricted so that the sustainable and natural renewal of salmon stocks is assured .
after the enlargement of the union , the protection of the baltic sea , maintenance of its fish stocks and organisation of fishing activity in the region will no longer be matters of multilateral cooperation but a bilateral issue between the eu and russia .
i believe that russia for its own part is prepared to take up the challenge of cooperation ; the main responsibility , however , lies with us , the eu and the member states of the union .
mr president , i was interested to hear commissioner byrne say that some of the findings exceed the limits .
this is because , according to press reports when this scientific study was first published , a statement was issued claiming that a spokesperson from commissioner byrne 's office had agreed with the assessment made by the united kingdom food standards agency that the levels of chemicals in our european salmon did not exceed eu limits .
i welcome the fact that this position has now been revised , because what we are talking about here is about consumers .
background levels have to be taken into account .
the issue needs to be addressed as to why those background levels are there in the first place .
that is something that also has to be tackled .
from these studies it has been quite clear that farmed salmon have a significantly higher contaminant burden than wild salmon – that is what the report says – and that farmed salmon from europe are significantly more contaminated than farmed salmon from south and north america .
a lot of people have long seen that there is obviously some sort of health risk in relation to farmed fish .
we are now saying that consumption of farmed salmon should be limited to a certain amount per week , or per month , which raises a question about the threat to consumers .
it should be clearly labelled so that consumers know what they are eating and have that choice .
i raised the issue with the president of parliament , pat cox , and asked him to request the european food safety authority to issue a scientific opinion on the problem .
he agreed to do so .
unfortunately , we have still not received the letter which he was going to send .
it is crucial that this should not be further delayed , because we are not just talking about salmon here .
an issue which has not been raised at all is that other <unk> fish species , for example tuna , cod , sea bass , sea bream and trout , are farmed in similar conditions and probably exposed to similar contamination .
this is an issue which needs to be addressed , not just in relation to farmed salmon but in relation to other farmed fish .
finally , i see that the united kingdom government has adopted protection principles to safeguard scottish salmon .
they should adopt protection methods to safeguard the consumer .
mr president , let me say unequivocally that if there are proven problems of a serious health or environmental nature linked to eu-produced salmon , then the matter must be dealt with seriously and swiftly .
however , there must be accurate , reliable and totally independent scientific advice before any such action can be undertaken .
it will not surprise the commission that i am somewhat sceptical , to say the least , in relation to some scientific studies currently doing the rounds and which , i believe , prompted the present crisis .
i am not interested in who did the study .
i am , however , interested in who paid for the study .
i am also interested to know if there are vested interests involved in this work , if there is anyone who stands to gain from this type of so-called scientific research .
for me , the crisis in the salmon sector is not just environmental ; the real crisis is that the eu salmon industry , particularly in my constituency of <unk> in the west of ireland , is under serious threat of extinction .
the entire community industry is under threat from cheap imports , or to put it another way , from dumping of farmed salmon from norway , chile and the faroe islands .
it is totally unacceptable to me that a growing number of independent irish and scottish producers are going into receivership .
if this continues unchecked , there will be no environmental or health issues to resolve because there will be no eu salmon .
in recent days , both the irish and uk governments made a joint application to the european commission for new measures to safeguard our salmon-farming industry .
the application does not concern the canadian or the american producers ; it concerns the eu producers , starting with irish producers who are fighting for survival .
in conclusion , i ask the commission to tell me and the irish salmon producers , whom i represent , what follow-up or initiative it has taken to date , or intends to take , on the joint <unk> kingdom application ?
– mr president , commissioner , the question of farmed salmon before us today is a genuine case study that is surely destined to be repeated many times over in years to come .
as politicians we are not armed with scientific knowledge , yet how are we to address a crisis that may have far-reaching socio-economic consequences for entire sectors ?
how can we solve a problem that has arisen from the publication of a scientific report that casts doubt on the sanitary quality of a food product , that has been published as part of a root and branch reputation review , and that has already been widely covered in the media , thereby raising concerns among consumers ?
how do we distinguish between what is based on well-founded concerns , calling for the most stringent measures and protocols to be put in place , and what is based on effects that are simply due to defects in the mathematical models used or in the balance of parameters ?
having had our fingers severely burnt by previous crises , which had devastating consequences – such as the crises involving mad cow disease , and dioxin in chickens , the case before us today , evidenced by the abnormally high death rate among bees , of the danger of new and extremely powerful neurotoxic molecules , which are used to coat seeds , getting into fats and water – we are being vigilant and must continue to err on the side of vigilance .
it is only by redoubling the controls , the studies , the research and the analysis that indisputable results will begin to come through to reassure consumers .
the food safety authorities are there to help us in this aim , but parliament must also give a ruling .
i should also like to remind you at this juncture , as a member of the scientific and technological options assessment ( stoa ) , that we have a novel type of body available to us in the european parliament , the stoa panel , whose function is to provide members of this house with aspects of scientific assessment that they may need in order to clarify the positions that our various committees are required to take .
it is by no means a perfect institution , but i feel that the stoa is capable of offering us invaluable help , such as providing us , in regard to a question such as the one before us this evening , with an overall perspective and a critical analysis of all scientific studies in existence or ongoing .
we must therefore not overlook this invaluable instrument .
. mr president , i wish to begin by answering some of the questions posed by mr ó neachtain , because he asked who funded the report which appeared in magazine and caused all the problems .
few realise that the research on which the article was founded was commissioned by the <unk> <unk> charitable trusts , worth an estimated usd 0.0 billion .
they are well known for their international campaigns against global pollution and they have recently become influential opponents of the aquaculture industry .
the magazine article – based on a usd 0.0 million research project carried out by the institute for health and the environment at the state university of new york at <unk> – has , as previous speakers have said , proved to be deliberately misleading in the advice it provides on salmon consumption .
and yet , i think all of us in this chamber would be astonished at how that article suddenly appeared in newspapers all over the world .
the reason is that on the day it was published in magazine it was sent out by press release by an international pr company based in new york and simultaneously appeared on the website of the <unk> <unk> foundation , which campaigns on behalf of <unk> wild salmon and which , of course , has a vested interest in damaging the european farmed salmon industry .
in their conclusions about limiting salmon consumption , the study 's authors appear , as mrs stihler said , to have misapplied an already suspect risk model developed by the us environmental protection agency by failing to include any analysis of the health benefits of eating salmon , despite over 0 000 scientific papers attesting to the necessity of eating oil-rich fish as a regular component of a balanced diet .
the research does not actually contain any new information : the data the research provides is no different from the findings of previous studies that also found dioxin levels in farmed salmon to be well within official safety limits .
however , the interpretation used in the research paper deliberately exaggerates the health risks .
moreover , the pcb levels in all eu farmed salmon are significantly below the level determined to be safe for sale in supermarkets , even by the us food and drug administration , as well as by all other international watchdogs , including our own eu food standards agency and the uk food standards agency .
the american research is therefore seriously flawed .
eu fish farms undertake rigorous inspection and quality control regimes to ensure that only the highest possible environmental and welfare standards are met and that the public is provided with an entirely safe , non-toxic and reliable product .
mr president , consumers are entitled to know what they are eating , and i fully support that as a public health imperative .
however , in order to make properly informed choices , it is essential that scientific information be accurate , up-to-date and verifiable .
in recent times , looking from scotland , it is perfectly possible to believe that certain campaigners are making it their business to talk down specifically the scottish salmon-farming industry and talk up specifically , as has been suggested , wild salmon from certain other areas .
just publishing an article in a magazine entitled does not automatically verify the accuracy of its contents .
it is clear , as the commissioner acknowledged , that there is no new evidence in the particular study published in .
it is also clear that the levels of various contaminants were within standards set by the european commission and the uk and scottish food standards agencies , which are not bodies that are easy to satisfy in that regard .
the research totally failed to mention the positive health benefits that can be gained from eating fatty fish such as salmon .
organisations such as scottish quality salmon , which has very high standards , should be encouraged .
they require of their members constant improvement in such things as feed quality .
it is inexplicable to me to suggest that scottish and irish salmon , but not other farmed salmon fed on exactly the same feed , somehow did not come out of this study as measuring up to the same standards .
the measured approach adopted by the commissioner is right , and i hope that , as others have said , there will be support for measures to protect this industry , which in scotland is essential for employment and social cohesion in very fragile areas .
mr president , this is clearly a very important subject .
salmon farming has often been criticised in the past for its environmental impact , but only recently have potential health impacts been raised .
it is crucial that these be better understood .
health advice given by governments across the eu traditionally highlights the importance of eating more fish .
yet , if risk analysis suggests that consumption of farmed atlantic salmon poses health risks that detract from the beneficial effect of fish consumption , then we need to know more about that .
we need to understand more about it and we need to act on that knowledge .
we need to know for certain that farmed salmon has more contaminants than wild fish and that dioxins are among the most toxic chemicals ever created .
so far the debate has been dominated by arguments over whether the contamination found in the salmon was legal .
what we should be concentrating on is whether the salmon is genuinely safe .
that might well mean revisiting the limits that were set for contamination in 0000 .
i want to get away from the arguments for or against scottish salmon or any other kind of salmon .
these are not very helpful .
we should be talking about whether aquaculture itself is providing a viable and environmentally sustainable food for humans , and i would argue that the answer is increasingly looking like ' no ' .
also associated with aquaculture is a whole range of other problems , including the spread of disease and parasites to wild fish , the use of fish , fishmeal and fish oil as food with impacts on wild fish stocks , pollution of the sea floor from <unk> food , the impact on predators when they are killed and the antibiotics used to control the disease .
there are some genuinely important issues here that need to be looked at and yet , perversely , governments continue to support aquaculture when , in many ways , they might well be better off putting their time and resources into rehabilitating the natural habitats of salmon so as to allow the wild stocks to recover .
this latest health report on salmon should be taken as a wake-up call to change the way we farm fish .
i look forward to a commission revision of the standards based on genuine safety measures , not on allowances for background environmental levels , because health cannot and should not be compromised .
. mr president , i should like to respond very briefly to the issues that have been raised .
i am happy that it has been acknowledged by parliament that the commission responded quickly to this issue and that a clear explanation was given when it first came into the public domain .
i should like to make a clarification statement and to repeat what i said earlier .
it would be a mistake to confuse the presence of dioxin and pcbs in the fish , and the presence of pesticides in feed .
one questioner suggested that the commission had made a statement earlier that was different from what is being said now .
that interpretation arises from a confusion of what has been said , which is that the dioxin levels are within eu maximum levels , but the pesticides in food are not , and i gave two instances that were above that .
that is a question of the levels being above the appropriate levels in the feed rather than in the fish themselves .
in answer to the question i was asked by mr ó neachtain in relation to the joint report that has been furnished by the irish and united kingdom authorities , i have to say that report has not reached my desk , nor has it reached my dg .
i am , of course , making inquiries about it , but that report may have been on a related issue and sent to a different dg .
it is something i will look at if it has been sent to me and if it is relevant to my portfolio .
finally , on the question of further risk assessments , the european food safety authority is carrying out a risk assessment on the presence of <unk> pcbs .
it is quite clear that my services and the european food safety authority are keeping an eye on this issue .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the commission statement on the crisis in the steel sector .
. mr president , the european parliament scheduled this declaration from the commission only a few days ago when the future of thyssen krupp 's <unk> terni plant was at stake .
the decision to close magnetic steel production would put 000 jobs directly and larger numbers indirectly at risk .
further job losses in the region already affected in the past would be a most unwelcome blow .
it would be particularly unfortunate , in view of the long tradition of steel making in this region , the quality of the product produced at terni and the skill levels of the workforce involved .
therefore it is with some relief that i heard reports today of an announcement by the italian minister of productive activities , mr <unk> , that the deadline of the decision on the future of the <unk> plant has been postponed to a date yet to be defined .
it is precisely because of concerns such as these , regarding the social consequences of corporate restructuring , that the commission has sought to promote a response at community level to the issue of how corporate restructuring is managed .
we sought , with the active involvement of the social partners , to develop and promote issues that seem relevant in the present case , investing in people on a permanent basis , developing employability through training and retraining , seeking alternatives to closures and redundancies , redeploying , wherever possible , workers affected by restructuring operations and anticipating market and technological developments .
i should like to remind you that two years ago the commission launched a consultation with the social partners , particularly on this issue of restructuring , because unfortunately , there were many problems in many different member states .
the commission presented a report with some proposals .
we have the response of the social partners in october and we believe that through dialogue and agreed measures , particularly on issues to which i have already referred , everything that supports employability , the social partners can play an important role .
it is my sincere hope that in the window of opportunity that now appears to have opened all such possibilities will be given full consideration to see what contribution they can make to alleviating the crisis faced by the terni plant .
– mr president , commissioner , europe cannot remain silent in the face of what is happening in one of the union ’s most important <unk> sites : without any prior notification the thyssen krupp group has decided to halt the production of magnetic steel in the steel plants of terni .
this is an unwarranted action and betrays an agreement signed up to in 0000 during privatisation .
as noted by you , commissioner , the german company is preparing to sack hundreds of workers because it prefers to protect other european sites and invest outside the union , in south korea .
thanks to the intervention of the italian government – you mentioned , commissioner , the intervention of mr <unk> , the minister for productive activities – and the extraordinary extent to which all the local institutions , citizens , parties and workers have mobilised themselves , thyssen krupp has decided to put off its decision to close the plant .
the european parliament and the commission cannot , however , raise their voices to help solve a crisis which is not , mr president , commissioner , an italian issue , but involves the whole of europe .
that is why we are asking that the commission , when presenting the third report on economic and social cohesion on 00 february , clearly sets out its own proposals for protecting the industrial sector and , in particular , the iron and steel industry in the context of its new cohesion policy due to commence from 0 january 0000 .
i am also convinced that the commission ’s battle with the us in respect of market shares in steel production must be supported .
i repeat that the problem does not concern only italy , nor is it a purely incidental matter , but rather a general problem facing the steel industry in europe .
the crisis involves not just one company , but many and it seems to me that the commission in comparison to the us it giving it its full attention .
indeed , we cannot adopt a carefree and superficial approach to such a sensitive issue on which the future of thousands and thousands of jobs , and therefore of thousands and thousands of families , hangs .
as regards the italian case of terni , i am convinced that the commission must intervene to deal with certain anomalies .
the steelworks in terni , in contrast to what was established in december 0000 by the commission for the control of concentrations , are currently owned exclusively by thyssen krupp , this being a clear example of a concentration : the group is currently the only producer of magnetic <unk> steel in europe .
does not the commission consider that this is potentially a distortion of competition ?
furthermore , because of its activities in italy , thyssen krupp has received community aid on the grounds that terni , where the steelworks are located , is a region in industrial decline that comes within objective 0 .
does the commission not therefore consider that it should check whether the community aid has been employed correctly by thyssen krupp ?
next , does not the commission consider that it should check whether thyssen krupp has received further state aid in breach of the competition rules ?
the investment in south korea , announced yesterday , is a source of concern : i would not want european funds and possible funding provided by the german government to be used not for boosting european economic growth , employment and development in europe , but employed in south korea , in the sole interests of one company which – i repeat – has not upheld the agreements it signed up to with italy when privatisation took place .
thousands of workers are now waiting for the commission to take action in order to ensure that the union ’s rules are observed .
a few days ago i heard president prodi and commissioner monti speak and even in what you said , commissioner , i perceive a desire to move forward , to protect workers ’ interests , to resolve a problem which – i repeat – is not limited geographically to italy .
i am convinced that the president of the commission , after listening to the thyssen krupp management , will take decisive measures to intervene in the way that i hope so that the commission may act collectively .
the president of the commission and all the commissioners should continue in their present direction : they can count on parliament ’s support as demonstrated by the desire to reach a unified resolution on this sensitive and important issue , which i think will be adopted unanimously .
– mr president , for those who were lucky enough , like me and other members , to take part in the strike and the demonstration at terni on friday 0 february , the deeper meaning of this struggle was very clear : an entire city and an entire region were united and determined to reject not merely a harsh blow against their production plant and their jobs but , above all , an attack on their dignity .
with many years trade union experience behind me , seldom have i witnessed such tension and such pride .
the announcement to close the magnetic section of st by thyssen krupp means the loss of 000 highly qualified jobs and internal disruption as a result in the terni iron and steel plant thereby posing an immediate threat to its plans , its productive capacity and its overall job prospects : we are talking of 0 000 jobs , including those companies affected by the knock-on effects .
over and above that , though , this is , i repeat , a slap in the face for regional local government which has worked effectively and is still working , by utilising the structural funds , to create a more favourable climate of production for the company and its investments : infrastructure projects , training and professional retraining , energetic supply measures .
up until yesterday everything was fine ; then , in september 0000 , production for electric motors , that is to say <unk> steel , was abandoned .
at that time , and again in november , a solemn commitment was given concerning all the programmes aimed at making terni a centre of excellence for magnetic steel .
at the end of january , however , after only two months , there was an about turn : even the production of <unk> steel used for <unk> was closed down and the closure of the plant was announced with dramatic internal consequences : there was a threat that the plant would be broken up destroying its integrated structure which , given the varied nature of its production , enabled it to balance out market fluctuations and disperse strategic functions such as marketing .
it also had major external consequences affecting italy and europe in general .
magnetic steel , which is produced only in terni , is the only special strategic steel for the energy sector ; becoming dependent on russia and the us will also have a negative knock-on effect for users who are major exporters .
the news that arrived at the end of the meeting held today in <unk> <unk> therefore explains why the workers and the inhabitants of the city took to the streets and why they have been able to broaden their network of alliances and support .
on 00 february genuine negotiations will finally get under way without a gun being held to the trade union ’s head .
the deadline of 00 february has been cancelled , 00 contracts which had expired and which thyssen krupp wanted to cancel are being renewed ; it is a sign that the multinational feels isolated .
in response to this preliminary result the pressure must be maintained and the attention of all the institutions must be kept engaged .
on thursday this parliament will make its voice heard with a resolution on this issue which genuinely symbolises the need for new systems of industrial relations and more advanced methods for linking public investment and industrial strategy .
we are fighting to ensure that there is a clear message that the dispute should end in a positive manner : a decisive dispute to put a stop to the downgrading of production in italy and the weakening of industrial plant throughout europe .
– mr president , in 0000 robert schuman launched the idea of a european coal and steel community open to all states , thereby creating the basis for the complex and difficult journey of european unification , the most recent developments of which we are now experiencing .
even then the importance of steel in the european context was clear .
i am not surprised therefore that the debate in this parliament concerning the ‘ terni case ’ has aroused so much interest and the opinions expressed have to a large extent not been dependent on political affiliations .
the european iron and steel sector is currently suffering as a result of the decision taken by the us to impose import duties on steel , principally from the european union .
the crisis in italy is important because it involves other iron and steel centres , like the steel plant in <unk> .
in that context , the announcement by thyssen krupp , the owner of the terni iron and steel plant , that it is going to invest in south korea to produce steel in asia is of major importance and is causing a good deal of concern .
as you know , the terni plant was sold in 0000 as part of the process of privatisation promoted by the institute for reconstruction of industry ( <unk> ) , subject to a guarantee that its activities would continue in italy and that jobs would be protected .
this is not a company in crisis but a company that produces a leading-edge product used to make thin metal sheets for electronic <unk> .
furthermore , there are no other factories of this type in italy . the technology used at terni and the studies and research carried out in recent years are of an extremely high standard .
losing skills and know-how is exactly the opposite of the knowledge economy to which president prodi recently referred in this parliament .
it is no coincidence that directors , managers , researchers and local politicians lined up alongside the workforce to fight on behalf of the product and the research associated with it .
about 000 workers are likely to lose their jobs , not counting the knock-on effects .
we cannot , therefore , ignore the fact that the german multinational received funds and tax breaks from the european union when it decided to acquire the terni plant .
i also wonder what the significance is , in global terms , of transferring production to korea , what technological skills workers employed in south-east asia have , what trade union rights they have and whether those rights will be observed .
at a meeting last december , some european union industrial manufacturers in the footwear and textiles sector posed a number of questions concerning those matters to the delegation from china , which is preparing itself to become the factory of the world .
the replies were extremely evasive and we had no grounds for thinking that elsewhere on the continent – with the exception of japan – the situation was any better .
above all , in a market economy based on competition the rules must …
– mr president , nine hundred jobs lost may be no more than a statistic , but it amounts to more for the lives of the human beings affected .
the plant in terni is at the very heart of the city ’s fabric ; 000 jobs : the lives of young and old workers .
the steelworks in terni are the city ’s history and pride ; they represent the memories of the air raids that took place in the second world war .
when the management of thyssen krupp announced the closure of the magnetic steel section , the whole city – as mr sacconi said – took to the streets with the workers .
terni is not an isolated operation : in europe , arcelor , <unk> and thyssen itself are currently preparing to reorganise production ; plants in belgium , the blast furnaces of <unk> in trieste have already received threats of closure , despite trade union action .
massive disinvestment and relocation of valuable products to non-european countries are in fact destroying european production capacity .
community funds , which have been considerable over recent decades , have been used to dismantle state controlled iron and steel works .
the subsidies paid to private entrepreneurs such as riva , <unk> , <unk> and other foreign groups have been used for the <unk> of production capacity and the specialisation of the italian iron and steel industry along profit-making lines .
the european social fund and the structural funds have been used to finance restructuring and retraining programmes and have led to a younger workforce being employed in the sector – in italy today the average age of iron and steel workers is 00 – but it is precisely this new generation of highly qualified young employees whose existence is under threat .
in my view , the absence of a coordinated plan in the european union to relaunch the iron and steel industry has contributed to individual plants in various countries – albeit at the cutting edge – being transferred elsewhere in order to fit in with the industrial plans of individual entrepreneurs .
the thyssen plant in terni , which is currently suffering heavy losses in the magnetic steel sector to the benefit of the russian company <unk> , is cutting back production and preparing to transfer operations to mexico , korea , china and india .
there is no sign of innovation , new research or competitive challenge : the only thing visible is a dangerous move towards retrenchment which , if not stopped in time , will have repercussions for employment and social cohesion , not just in italy but throughout europe .
despite the drastic reduction of employment in the sector in italy , which has fallen from 000 000 jobs in the 0000s to 00 000 today , the steel sector still has an excellent position in the market because it is the second european producer .
in order to maintain that position , however , requires industrial choices to be made by the italian government – which do not appear to be forthcoming – and a clear commitment of intent at european level .
steel and electricity are economic indicators of absolute excellence in a country , a measure of economic development .
it is therefore essential that the european union introduce systems for tackling pollution and monitoring the environmental impact , which are priorities if the aims of the kyoto protocol are to be pursued .
on this basis a new steel industry can be launched .
we must find solutions in the form of industrial policies geared to protecting quality products , environmental conditions and employment in the iron and steel sector .
in this sense , in response to threats to employment and gradual social impoverishment , the commission should give a commitment to review the rules governing the structural funds .
granting of those funds in future should be made conditional on a binding commitment being given to invest in a given location for at least ten years , subject to an explicit agreement that the subsidies will be reclaimed in the event that production is moved elsewhere .
in my view , directive 00/00 on protection in respect of collective dismissals should also be reviewed so as to consolidate the measures designed to protect employment by making provision not only for information procedures for workers ’ representatives , but also requiring a commitment on the part of the social partners to open appropriate and binding negotiations with a view to preventing dismissals or the reorganisation of production to the detriment of employment .
the jobs in the steelworks at terni must be saved , as must the jobs in other italian and european plants and for this reason i believe that a meeting is required between the governments of the member states concerned , the social partners and , in this specific case , thyssen krupp , to draw up a new industrial plan to relaunch the magnetic and <unk> sectors at european level .
– mr president , once again italy risks being used as a dumping ground .
thyssen krupp is the only case of a multinational that has grown thanks to the work of hundreds of italian workers and huge funds placed at its disposal , either by the italian state or the european union , and then has decided to close , in this case in terni , in umbria , with the risk of leaving 000 workers and their families destitute and also wasting a huge resource of professional skills .
as other members have mentioned , the announcement of closure took everybody by surprise : no prior notice was given to the workers or the national and local authorities and , above all , no justification was given because today the closure appears to be dictated more by questionable strategic company choices than by specific technical reasons , given that in italy production costs are lower , the quality is higher and the professionalism of the workforce beyond question : there have been steelworks at terni for 000 years .
would it , i ask myself , be acceptable for thyssen krupp to go ahead with the decision to close after taking everything possible from that territory and those people : professionalism , resources and even their hopes for the future ?
meanwhile production has already been moved to india , with an eye on china , where the cost of labour is ridiculous and laws for the protection of workers and the environment non-existent .
further , as other members have already stated , these multinationals often take advantage of the opportunity offered by privatisation – which unfortunately , most of the time , are no more than asset sales – to acquire our family jewels at knock down prices , as was exactly the case with thyssen krupp at terni .
so , moving beyond these contentious matters , what are we asking of the european commission ?
firstly , we are asking for immediate measures , within its powers , to safeguard the iron and steel centre in terni and to avert the danger of thyssen krupp ’s plant being closed ; secondly : a commitment to check that european regulations are effectively applied in order to protect workers ’ rights ; thirdly : a further commitment to make the granting of community funds conditional on agreements guaranteeing employment and subject to precise conditions and limits on the relocation of plant .
we also expect a committed development strategy to be set in place for the iron and steel sector throughout europe .
finally , should thyssen krupp go ahead with its decision to close the plant , we call on the commission to check whether all the competition rules have been complied with , in particular as regards any possible abuse of a dominant position .
in conclusion , mr president , whilst we are satisfied with the initial positive steps today of the italian government , gained as a result of determined action across the board , we consider that that is all the more reason not to lower our guard .
we believe unreservedly in the free market , but we also believe that there is no free market without democracy and , above all , without respect for workers and nations .
– mr president , commissioner , i think it is important to check , in the thyssen krupp affair in terni , whether any infringements have occurred under community law ; whether there is state aid that undermines the german group ’s choices of location ; whether – as asserted by mr angelilli – there is an abuse of a dominant position ; whether contracts with the italian government or the european institutions have been broken ; whether , in other words , commitments given in respect of facilities or funding granted have been observed .
in my view , this is the task of the european institutions , but i also think that that task should stop there .
i do not think it is the task of the european commission , the european institutions or the italian government to criticise the decisions of companies operating in europe to relocate .
there is outcry at the scandalous possibility that certain products are to be transferred to india , china or south america .
personally , i consider that that is part of the rules of the game which certain countries in the european union – primarily italy – have taken advantage of for many years : placing at the disposal of the international economy its own assets , for example the availability of labour .
in conclusion , mr president , i would make the point that italy and europe need the confidence of investors to invest in terni , just like anywhere else .
to imagine that politicians can criticise in this way the choices made by investors would not be to render a good service , nor would it serve any real useful purpose for employment .
– mr president , ladies and gentlemen , representing a constituency in the north of france , i have indeed had painful experience of steel industry restructuring in my region .
in the 0000s and 0000s , brand new factories were closed down .
i have to tell you once again this evening : twenty years on , that wound is still open and sore .
i therefore feel the current crises particularly keenly , especially that of terni , where 000 jobs are under threat .
while i was preparing this speech , after reading the motion for a resolution , i re-read my report on steel , which parliament approved in 0000 .
at the time , having observed that successive restructuring had cost over 000 000 jobs in twenty years , i was in a position to state that , and i quote item f , ‘ the community steel industry may these days be regarded as generally <unk> and technological effective , even though the problem of overcapacity could emerge again in the event of a new crisis ’ .
two years later , towards the end of 0000 , the industry was struck by a devastating crisis following a market crash in asia .
since then , we have seen a succession of crises – some small , some large-scale , the result of local or world level restructuring – leading to a catalogue of redundancies .
as recently as the beginning of 0000 , it was arcelor and the announcement of thousands of job losses .
today it is terni and the thousand jobs deemed surplus to requirements .
without wishing to attribute greater importance to my 0000 report than it deserves , reading it brought back to me the risks that were already bubbling under the surface : unbridled globalisation , american pressure and production at the cost of the social and environmental aspects .
it also recalled , however , measures that were needed to prevent further crises – measures in terms of social acquis and social rights , conditions of state aid , training for employees , respect for the environment , diversification , research , new products and the penetration of new markets .
the motion for a resolution before us recalls others , and this proves , unfortunately , that our warnings were not heeded .
the terni situation is symptomatic .
this is why we must rein in the great <unk> machine , not only because the workers demand it of us , but also because if we let go , then great <unk> of the european iron and steel industry will go by the wayside .
in this context , despite the efforts and sacrifices of workers in the past , there is a danger that the european steel industry will disappear completely , followed swiftly by those industries that use steel products ; in the fullness of time , therefore , it will be european industry as a whole that is under threat .
further proof that there is no such thing as a good economy without a social element , without training and without respect for the workers .
in the short-term , some will make a profit , but that is not the issue for us .
the issue for us is defending the economy , industry and jobs .
mr president , as members said , the relocation of companies to countries with cheaper labour is a permanent phenomenon of economic history .
i should like to make a few specific comments based on the statements made by the honourable members on the role and facility for intervention of the european union .
first , as far as the international dimension is concerned , it is clear that global negotiations are under way on the question of steel and the european union wants to achieve an agreement on subsidies because , as we know , there are countries which grant subsidies , especially outside the frameworks of the world trade organisation .
the second point is european social law .
and i think that here it is very important to know that , of course , the final decision on a company is taken by the company 's management , but it is obliged to follow the specific directives on consultation with workers and on information , and prompt information , for them , and community law on mass redundancies .
the implementation of these directives in the first stage , because they are national law , concerns every country and , of course , it also concerns the european union , because they are european law .
the third point is the structural funds , in other words european money for companies .
here we can see two categories of intervention by the european union .
first , as regards direct subsidies to companies .
i would remind you that , for several years now , subsidies in the steel sector have not been allowed .
they are banned on the basis of the ecsc treaty and continue to be banned but , where state corporations are subsidised , then there are commitments , there are agreements .
a company cannot take european money and not keep to the terms on which it was granted and , of course , in such cases , the agreements are signed at national level and the national courts have jurisdiction to impose any sanctions .
the question of subsidies is one aspect of the structural funds .
the second , however , which is also important , is intervention in the matter of addressing the social repercussions .
and here it is important for us to see that there is experience in many countries of restructuring of the structural funds , especially the social fund , in order to support workers and , even more importantly , to retrain them .
the most important weapon in restructuring of companies is continuing training of workers so that they can deal with the problems of their sector and can re-enter the job market at any time .
so i think that it is important in the negotiations taking place at the moment at trilateral level , between companies , workers and the italian government , for account to be taken of this possibility of supporting and assisting the workers via the social fund .
i have received six motions for resolutions to wind up the debate ( 0 ) tabled in accordance with rule 00 ( 0 ) of the rules of procedure .
the debate is closed .
the vote will be on thursday .
the next item is the oral question to the commission ( o-0000 / 0000 ) , by philip bushill-matthews and bartho pronk on behalf of the ppe-de group , on demographic trends in the eu .
mr president , i am delighted that the house has agreed to debate this important topic .
i also hope that this is an issue on which the whole house can unite on a cross-party basis .
the subject is not just about demographic trends in general .
my oral question specifically asks for more attention to be given to issues associated with ageing .
too often , ageing is just seen as a problem ; it should also be seen as an opportunity .
there are many aspects to be reviewed , but in the time available i will just focus on one : the opportunity for the elderly to continue in work if that is their wish .
i therefore welcome the approach taken by the employment task force chaired by wim kok .
this report refers to one of the lisbon council conclusions that is often overlooked , that by 0000 the target is for 00 % of 00-00 year-olds to be in employment .
currently , only sweden , denmark , portugal and the united kingdom have reached this target .
belgium , italy , france , luxembourg and austria have employment rates for older workers of less than 00 % .
delaying the average age at which people leave the labour force is crucial .
luxembourg , belgium and france among the current member states , plus poland , lithuania , hungary and slovakia among the incoming member states all have average work exit ages well below the eu average .
they will be particularly stretched to meet the agreed target and their policies will have to change radically in order to achieve it .
will they grasp the challenge ?
but even the eu as it exists today will miss the 00 % target unless it can increase the number of older workers in work by seven million over the next seven years .
this means that two-thirds of the current 00-00 age group must still be active in the labour market in 0000 .
this means in turn a significant change , because only half of those in this group and in employment in 0000 were still working ten years later .
this is the reason i tabled this question .
it is a matter for member states , but the issue is : will member states act on these employment task force conclusions within a defined and early timetable ?
will the commission put together an early progress report to present to parliament , ideally by the end of this year ?
finally , will member states implement all the provisions on age discrimination in the employment directive without further delay ?
i hope the answer to all of these can be ' yes ' .
mr president , mr bushill-matthews and mr pronk , on behalf of the ppe-de group , have submitted a series of questions to which i shall reply .
of course , i too hope that the answer to the last three questions will be yes , which means very close cooperation and decisiveness by the commission and , more importantly , the member states .
your first question concerns what the commission intends to do in order to achieve the objectives of the lisbon summit , as far as demographic trends are concerned . the demographic problem is , at the moment , at the epicentre of our three basic policies , economic policy , especially public finances , the policy on employment and the policy on social cohesion .
the question of ageing is now , as you will see , the basic element in the general orientations of economic policy and the guidelines of the strategy for employment , with specific targets .
i particularly want to tell you that this year , in the spring 0000 report , we have set three priorities , one of which is the promotion of active ageing , which essentially means the extension of professional life .
we have three categories of action .
one relates to abolishing economic disincentives , which essentially discourage workers from delaying their retirement .
in many countries , the regime which exists today is that it is more profitable to retire than to remain in work , because you earn less .
so there is the serious question of disincentives .
the second is the promotion of access to training for all workers , but especially elderly workers , and here we have set specific quantitative targets .
the third is improving the quality of work .
the commission , within these frameworks of efforts to put demographic ageing at the centre of its policies , is proposing to extend the open method of coordination to modernising the care system and the social protection system .
here we have a particular problem , which concerns the increased burden both from the economic point of view and from the workload point of view and , hence , from the point of view of serving very old people since , due to the changes in our society , it would appear that the health systems cannot play the role which they played in the past .
your second question concerns flexibility in retirement rules and is particularly topical .
as you yourself said , we have set specific targets .
we have set the lisbon targets , to increase the employment rate of the elderly to 00 % , and the barcelona targets , to increase the average age at which workers leave the job market by five years by 0000 .
these targets are being monitored by the commission .
every year , as you know , we publish indicators and tables and it is clear that the member states are not making efforts to the same degree to give us results .
at the moment , we are examining , together with the social protection and employment committees , how social systems obstruct or favour easy retirement .
the final report is at your disposal , it will be submitted again in 0000 , and we can see what the problems are in each system as regards incentives to retire , disability benefits , unemployment benefits , older workers and dependents ' pensions , and how the logic of incentives rather than the logic of integrating these people into the job market has also distorted the job market , as well as efforts by people themselves to enter the job market .
we believe that this report , which will be submitted to the european council , is also an important tool in the hands of the member states .
i must of course tell you that the european commission has constantly recommended the introduction of flexible retirement systems since 0000 and the response has not been as we expected .
as far as your third question on the results of the wim kok committee is concerned , we consider that they are extremely important , mainly because they go into detailed recommendations for each member state .
we have already included the kok report in the strategy on employment and our recommendations for all the countries will take account of this report .
i think that it is interesting that , in cooperation with both mr kok and the ministries of employment and social partners , we are presenting the conclusions of the committee to the member states in an effort to achieve greater publicity and galvanise not just the governments but also the social partners into implementing them .
mr president , commissioner diamantopoulou , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to begin by thanking the commissioner for her detailed and encouraging answer .
there has been a substantial rise in awareness of demographic ageing and its impact on the jobs market and social policy in the eu .
europe faces an enormous challenge in this area .
on the one hand , it is confronted with the possibility of failing to meet targets set at the lisbon council in the areas of employment , competitiveness and economic growth by 0000 .
at the same time , health care systems must achieve the three-pronged aim of health care access for all , higher levels of quality provided by these services and the financial viability of systems .
there is , moreover , enormous pressure on member states ’ social security systems to meet and to guarantee , in the future , the provision of pensions to an increasingly aged population .
the time has come , therefore , to take action .
we are aware that the complex implications of the ageing of the population , along with low birth rates , cannot be solved on an exclusively national level .
these problems affect different community policies , so what is needed is to develop europe-wide cooperation .
the first issue that therefore arises is to know in what way the commission will be able to support member states to provide adequate responses to the ageing of the population , either at health systems level or at employment policy level .
the conclusions of the task force chaired by wim kok suggest various measures that may be adopted to maintain economic growth and to promote active ageing .
a legislative and financial framework must be drawn up that might include such key measures as encouraging employers to hire and retain older workers , discouraging people from leaving the labour market early and increasing participation in life-long training .
in addition to the questions raised by mr bushill-matthews , whom i congratulate for his question to the commission , i should like to address the question of working women .
the increase in the contribution of women to the labour market is a further response , but one which requires measures to be adopted that make it easier to reconcile working life and family life .
i would ask the commission , and especially commissioner diamantopoulou , whether it is in a position to develop the mechanisms required to draw up a framework directive establishing a lowest common denominator on reconciling working life and home life .
– mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of my group , i have to say that i do not fully understand why mr bushill-matthews asked this question .
we are all aware of the problem , and the commissioner ’s reply has also demonstrated that something is being done , and that naturally pressure is also being put on member states as and where we can .
i think your points , particularly the three requests , are expressed in too summarised a form to seriously tackle the topic as a whole and all aspects of demographic change .
both the member states and the candidate countries are aware of the challenges .
let me refer you to the two reports our committee and parliament have already approved in 0000 and 0000 , which were produced by mr cercas and mr andersson .
i think you will find the subject receives much more thorough treatment in those reports .
we are not only talking about raising the age of retirement , as mr bushill-matthews has reminded us .
clearly one issue is the need to remove the incentives for taking early retirement .
of course , we also need to get rid of the discrimination older workers still often encounter in our labour market , such as the fact that they are rarely allowed to participate in further training , the way their experience is often under-used , the way they have no chance of any kind of promotion .
all this forms part of making the labour market attractive and reasonable for older workers .
there is certainly a lot of catching up to be done , both by the member states and on our side , which goes far beyond simply increasing the age of retirement .
of course , one other element , as mrs bastos has said , is to consider how we can promote child-friendly employment conditions in the european union ; how we can support women in combining work and family .
i think there is a hefty contradiction if the group of the european people ’s party ( christian democrats ) and european <unk> have no problem with calling for a 00 - or 00-hour working week , as they did yesterday , expects that , and never stops to consider that it completely rules out a child-friendly society .
i think this is another important point .
the third and last point is that of course we need to have an unbiased , open and serious discussion about an active immigration policy .
we should also seriously discuss the immigration strategy mentioned recently in this house by kofi annan .
i think all this belongs to a policy which establishes a balance between the generations and welfare as well as showing intergenerational solidarity , as it is often called here .
this is more important than simply talking about raising the retirement age .
mr president , commissioner , i am grateful for this question because our group is permanently very concerned not just about the problem of ageing , but also the combination of ageing and depopulation .
europe has an increasingly smaller and older population .
it will be hard for us to compete if we do not have people suitable for work .
i believe the time is coming when we must consider the introduction of a new criterion if we want possibilities for the future , a new criterion based on productive population density .
you are greek , commissioner .
i have been looking at the map of population density in europe , i have it here in front of me , and it indicates that more than half of your country , more than half of greece , has a population of less than 00 inhabitants per square kilometre .
they are areas with low population densities .
however , what would you think if i told you that , as well as that , half of your population is over 00 years old ?
so we are facing a situation with practically no future .
we must start looking into this problem , which is arising in many regions of europe , in spain , in scotland , in france , in certain regions of italy and also in greece .
the time is coming for us to begin to consider this concept of productive population density because it is necessary to competitiveness , because furthermore we are facing a repeated problem in spain which we call ‘ the fish that bites its own tail ’ .
we cannot take companies to places where there are no people , where there is no productive workforce , and where the productive workforce does not go because there are no companies .
we must find a way of breaking this vicious circle .
i will go further : in our region , in aragón , we have tried to move immigrants to rural areas : latin americans , <unk> , eastern europeans .
do you know what is happening ?
they stay for three , five , six months or a year and then leave , to a city or to the coast .
we must find some way to break this vicious circle .
the debate is closed .

the commission can accept all those amendments which are part of the compromise package worked out between the three institutions in order to achieve first reading agreement .
amendments nos 0 , 0 to 0 , 00 , 00 , 00 , 00 , 00 , 00 and 00 , outside the compromise package , are not acceptable to the commission .
on behalf of the european parliament , i welcome you , mr uribe , president of the republic of colombia , to this house <unk> is the second occasion during our parliamentary term – the fifth mandate of the european parliament – on which a president of colombia has addressed the plenary sitting of our house .
president pastrana spoke here in october 0000 , and today he is part of your official delegation , mr <unk> president , even as the european union enlarges to the east and to include two new mediterranean island member states , we in this parliament fully believe that eu relations with latin america must continue to be strengthened .
it is in that context in particular that we welcome you and your delegation here today .
we believe that an important step in this regard is the recent conclusion of a political dialogue and cooperation agreement last december with the andean community and therefore also with <unk> president , we know that yours is a state that suffers extremely high emigration , poverty , extraordinary security challenges including assassinations and kidnappings , and the extraordinary challenges of organised crime and <unk> .
in colombia you have paid a high price in violence and political <unk> parliament supports all efforts aimed at reforming and bringing peace to colombia , however there are fields which still need further action .
this parliament believes that in addition to military and security dimensions the prevailing conflict also demands political , social and economic responses .
we consider it essential , as has been the experience on our old continent , to develop a fully-functioning democratic state , with full and strong democratic institutions respecting human rights and the rule of law .
in this house we believe that exceptions in respect of human rights are not <unk> you know , the european parliament has demanded the release of all kidnapped persons held by armed groups in colombia .
today again , mr president , i return to this point and make in our house a special appeal to you to do your utmost to obtain the freedom of hostages , not least mrs ingrid betancourt , who has now been in captivity for almost two <unk> president , i invite you to address the house .
mr president , members of the conference of presidents , members of the bureau of parliament , chairmen of the committees , members of the european parliament , ladies and gentlemen : people who visit colombia very often say that it is a wonderful country , in complete contrast to the image portrayed by analysts and the media .
others say that it is an illegitimate , authoritarian and elitist state .
with the strengthening of the state , our pluralist democracy has made the transition from formal and rhetorical guarantees to effective and genuine ones .
the vote proposed by the government and held on 00 october was discussed and approved by the congress , its text was modified by the opposition and examined and reduced by the constitutional court .
<unk> and opponents had every opportunity to express their views .
nobody could complain of violation of their rights or government hostility .
the following day , the people elected 00 governors from amongst 000 candidates ; 000 mayors from amongst 0 000 candidates ; 000 deputies from 000 lists comprising 0 000 candidates .
the number of candidates was twice that of previous elections .
in several cities and departments , candidates from parties other than the traditional parties won , from organisations arising from the former guerrilla groups , from , shall we say , leftist or opposition groupings .
in the campaign they carried out , the government ’s main concern was to give them every possible guarantee .
and now that they are elected , the government has decided to work with them , within the constitution , regardless of the political reasons they were elected , transparently , and above all , with the patriotic task of uniting colombia in its diversity .
mayors and governors elected by the people have been victims of pressure and murder from terrorists .
at the beginning of this government , 000 mayors were threatened by the guerrillas and 000 were not able to carry out their duties in the territory of their jurisdiction .
the work done on security means that the problem persists in just 00 places .
for more than a century colombia discussed the popular election of mayors , as a fundamental step towards extending democracy .
the terrorist guerrillas demanded it as a condition for peace .
it was approved in the 0000s .
but that is the paradox of terrorism : it is the murderer who destroys the local democracy it calls for .
our state is made up of institutions which monitor one another and of the broad participation of public opinion , which means that the citizens are subject to the rule of law and not the whim of the authoritarian governor .
my government takes a democratic view of security , in order to protect all the citizens regardless of their ideas , of their economic situation , of whether they are employers or workers or whether or not they are supporters of the government .
dealing with 00 000 terrorists is not easy .
we are aware that our challenge is to overcome the terrorist threat transparently , as a starting point for building national unity and sustainable democratic security , which seeks to restore law and order .
while terrorism is the great violator of human rights , the state and the security forces are devoted to upholding them .
last year 00 000 members of the institutional forces were qualified in human rights .
in 0000 the public prosecutor received 000 complaints against the security forces for abuses of international humanitarian law .
the number was reduced to 000 in 0000 .
the monitoring bodies , the justice system and the government share the determination to severely punish any proven violation of human rights .
colombia feels gratitude and pride in the courage of its soldiers and policemen .
the sacrifice they have made in order to bring us peace has been immense : since august 0000 , 000 soldiers and policemen have been killed by antipersonnel mines alone , and 000 have been injured , many of them permanently mutilated .
our country is open to the vigilance of the international community .
at our request , we now have an office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights .
their recommendations are received with respect .
when the government believes they cannot be complied with , the issue is discussed frankly .
i recognise the role of human rights ngos , i value the work of many of them , despite the fact that i express my disagreement with reports which do not correspond to the facts .
in almost 0 000 000 square kilometres , with more than 000 000 of jungle , for years the state has not been present , replaced by terrorist organisations .
we have proposed extending the institutional capacity to protect the citizens .
of the country 's 0 000 municipalities , in 000 there was no police presence .
today there is a police presence in all of them , although we will not rest until the last of the urban centres is protected .
in 000 municipalities we have installed soldiers and marines , known as ‘ of my people ’ , who carry out their military service in their place of residence .
the results are encouraging , and there is great hope that , following their active period within the security forces , we can count on them as leaders in compliance with the law , forever .
between 0000 and 0000 , murders were reduced by 00 % , kidnappings by 00 % , massacres by 00 % , attacks on the population by 00 % .
in january 0000 there were 00 kidnappings compared to 000 in january 0000 , and murders were reduced by a further 00 % .
the murder of teachers , trade unionists and journalists has reduced and , fortunately , the murderers in several cases are already in jail , as a result of our determination to eliminate impunity .
i would like to re-state our enthusiasm and commitment to providing protection with particular emphasis on teachers , trade unionists and journalists , because no democracy can allow them to be murdered .
violent deaths of indigenous people , indigenous aid workers and environmentalists , cruelly persecuted by terrorist groups , have decreased as a result of state presence in the ancestral territories .
internal displacement is one of our great tragedies resulting from terrorism .
during the last year it was reduced by 00 % and 00 000 families have returned to their places of origin .
although we have made some progress , the job has hardly begun .
what country can accept 0 000 kidnappings in one year ?
the constitutional reform which introduces anti-terrorist laws was approved by congress amidst national and international debate .
the powers given to security forces to capture , intercept and carry out raids in cases of terrorism were subject to the subsequent approval of a statutory law , and also to other guarantees such as the obligation to bring the case before the courts within 00 hours , the immediate dispatch of a report to the public prosecutor and periodic scrutiny by congress .
the law is less stringent than those in force in many western democracies .
i believe that the world must reconsider the idea that this type of power placed in the hands of governments jeopardises human rights , since these must be respected fully and in the same way by both the judiciary and the executive .
i classify violent groups as terrorists on the basis of the nature of their actions , the democratic context of colombia , the comparable international legislation , the source of their resources and the results of their activities .
people who plant antipersonnel mines , kill children , take pleasure in their own cruelty and act <unk> can only be described as terrorists .
people who attack democracy , by means of violent action , while colombia is determined to offer guarantees to all expressions of political thought , can only be described as terrorists .
people who for ideological or other reasons use or threaten violence are defined as terrorists under the legislation of many countries .
likewise , anybody who behaves like that in colombia can only be described as a terrorist .
people who fund violence through illegal drugs and kidnappings , destroying the dignity , freedom and ecology of the people , can only be described as terrorists .
people who use poverty and inequality as a way to justify violence and then cause more poverty and more inequality through the exercise of that violence , can only be described as terrorists .
i am not opposed to a negotiated solution , but it must not be mixed with terrorism .
an end to hostilities is a requirement , but disarmament and demobilisation require long timescales .
colombia has had a generous tradition of negotiated solutions with armed groups .
my predecessor , president andrés pastrana , made a huge effort to negotiate with the farc .
his good faith and patriotism were deceived in a cowardly manner by the farc , which expanded their criminal empire while the nation waited and hoped for a peace agreement .
i have made democratic security a priority because that will make the armed groups appreciate the need to negotiate seriously , on pain of total annihilation by the institutions .
nevertheless , efforts have been made to begin negotiations with them .
with the help of the catholic church , of cuba , with the intervention of the group of friendly nations and the group of facilitator countries , we have sought dialogue with the eln .
there have been no results so far despite our willingness .
they are afraid of taking steps towards peace without the permission of the farc .
the catholic church offered to mediate with the illegal <unk> and i decided to allow it to continue .
i accepted that the peace commissioner should begin dialogue when these organisations declared an end to hostilities .
it is time to update and monitor this ceasefire , with regard to which the support of the organisation of american states is extremely useful , and this must quickly lead greater numbers of members of these groups to show a genuine desire for peace .
when the state and society is attacked violently the legal order is also attacked just as it is when it is claimed that they are being defended through appeals for violence and the action of vigilante groups .
we must recover the principle of exclusive institutional protection of citizens .
the demobilisation of <unk> contributes to achieving this aim .
the government ’s military action has been implacable against the vigilante sectors which have not respected the ceasefire .
this is demonstrated by the number of <unk> , which increased by 00 % in 0000 compared to 0000 , and the number of those captured , which increased by 000 % over the same period .
the draft law on alternative penalisation , which is being discussed widely , seeks to facilitate peace agreements , without impunity , in harmony with justice .
although its negotiation coincides with the process which is being put forward with the self-defence groups , it is needed even more for the guerrilla forces , which has more members and a greater level of demobilisation during the current government .
in that law we must look at the past and anticipate the future .
the <unk> of horrific crimes in the past is unacceptable today and it would also be unacceptable if tomorrow the law we adopt is modified in accordance with a political predisposition towards other perpetrators of terrorism who want to negotiate .
during this period of government almost 0 000 members of armed groups have been demobilised , 00 % of them members of the farc guerrilla organisation .
they have been received with complete generosity and the state has made huge efforts to help them reintegrate into society .
this number exceeds what has been achieved in peace processes over past decades .
the farc are holding more that 0 000 hostages , including congressmen , members of the security forces and the <unk> candidate ingrid <unk> , who has both colombian and french citizenship .
i understand the pain of their families and the international interest in a humanitarian agreement .
initially i made an end to hostilities and the initiation of dialogue a condition .
my talks with the church , the french government , the secretary-general of the united nations , kofi annan , and the families of the victims , led me to accept the quest for an agreement on the basis of negotiations held under the auspices of the united nations , the release of all hostages , and the commitment on the part of terrorists leaving prison not to return to offending , with effective guarantees , such as their residing in a country which respects the agreement .
without the effective guarantees that they will not return to crime , the government cannot release terrorist guerrillas .
otherwise , we would be <unk> the sacrifices of the security forces , discouraging their actions and withering the popular spirit of respecting the law .
we would be opening the door to constant extortion against the state and society .
we must bear in mind that on the one hand there are respectable citizens kidnapped by terrorists while on the other there are terrorists who are in jail .
we must bear in mind that war is one thing but terrorism is quite another .
in war there are parties whose legitimacy is recognised for the purposes of humanitarian agreements , while with terrorism there is a murderer and a victim which is society , the rights and welfare of which we must protect through institutional arms .
the authority cannot therefore give up on the rescue of hostages , despite the cruelty of the criminal , as demonstrated by the murders of <unk> <unk> , guillermo <unk> , doris gil , helmut <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and many members of the security forces .
murders of defenceless citizens by the farc when they thought the authorities were present in the neighbourhood of the captivity .
no negotiation can be allowed to strengthen the murderer .
colombia is a social democracy .
00 % of the country ’s budget , excluding debt repayments , is directed towards social protection , education and health , directly and by means of decentralisation .
terrorism has increased poverty .
building peace requires that we overcome that poverty .
the government is working on a plan known as ‘ the seven tools of equity ’ , which are : educational revolution , social protection , promoting economic solidarity , social management of the countryside , of public services , a country of owners and quality of urban life .
primary and intermediate education coverage reached 00.0 % ; the state technical education service will achieve its four-year goal of increasing from 0 000 000 students per year to 0 000 000 ; the various child nutrition programmes benefit 0 000 000 children ; the credit for small businesses increased last year by 00 % .
we have many social problems , but we are completely determined to overcome them .
the economy grew last year by between 0.0 % and 0 % , when we expected 0 % .
last year the unemployment rate dropped by three points and the scourge of unemployment stood at 00.0 % .
in colombia inequality is not due to private enterprise but to the lack of private enterprise .
organised private enterprise has top officials to contribute to solidarity with its workers and the rest of the population .
our employers pay the majority of fiscal obligations , and the latest fiscal reforms have increased their taxes .
terrorism has blocked the expansion of private enterprise and this has added poverty to the lack of business-like practices
we enthusiastically promote workers ’ companies , cooperatives and the participation of users and workers in the provision of public services .
we believe in social capitalism .
in order to combat the concentration points of rural property in the hands of drug traffickers and terrorists combined , we approved a law to speed up the procedures for seizing assets .
last year this rose from five definitive judgments to 00 .
the european union has given us extremely valuable support which i would like to thank you for .
the london declaration commits us deeply .
it has been a great source of democratic commitment , a great sign of european support .
the funding of the peace laboratories is welcomed by the community .
we need more cooperation in order to destroy drugs .
without drugs there would be no terrorism .
this is not a time for blaming some people because they produce it and others because they consume it .
the problem is so great that all permissive countries end up being producer , trafficker and consumer .
it is time to destroy drugs .
our rural workers who cultivate it feel deceived by the terrorists and that their dignity is violated .
they yearn for alternatives .
we now have 00 000 <unk> families to look after the areas free of coca and supervise the recovery of the jungle .
each receives around 0 000 dollars per year .
we need to increase this to 00 000 families .
young europeans must be aware that drugs have destroyed 0 000 000 hectares of tropical jungle in colombia , right at the access to the amazon basin , which is seriously threatened by this scourge .
we in the andean community are concerned that the european union has not decided to negotiate a free trade agreement with our countries , when it has updated it with mexico and chile , and proposes to bring it forward with mercosur .
the imperfections of andean integration which are used as a reason not to negotiate that treaty would be overcome on the basis of the obligations imposed by an agreement with the european union .
we are grateful for the extension of the general system of preferences and we respectfully request that it be maintained until it is replaced with a permanent agreement .
i address this parliament with profound respect , with gratitude for the interest you have shown and your constant assistance for colombia .
i am aware that the solutions my government is seeking to my country ’s complex problems are controversial .
i would repeat that i have faith in creative deliberation .
deliberation is more constructive than absence .
debate is more constructive than withdrawal .
constructive polemic produces more than the abandonment of seats .
you are aware of my intransigence toward terrorism .
my generation has not seen a single day of peace .
the country we want for our children and future citizens must be a country of peace and equity .
distinguished members of the european parliament , i would like to say to you once again that my love for democracy is profound .
president uribe , i should like to thank you for your address to the house .
in your closing remarks you talked about the benefits of dialogue .
i should like to inform the house that the president will be available this afternoon for bilateral meetings with group leaders and later this afternoon for dialogue with the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy .
mr president , as a head of state , this is an unparalleled level of engagement with this house .
we thank you for the prospect of dialogue with you in the course of the day .

the next item is a report ( a0-0000 / 0000 ) by mr brie , on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy , on afghanistan : challenges and prospects for the future [ 0000/0000 ( ini ) ] .
. – madam president , ladies and gentlemen , if you have ever visited afghanistan or endeavoured to become more deeply informed about it , you will know how appalling and how extensive is the damage that has been done there – materially , culturally , socially and in human terms .
civil wars , the power struggles of local warlords , the soviet war of occupation , the taliban dictatorship , and the northern alliance ’s bombardments too have killed and maimed millions , destroyed the economy of what was already an extremely poor country and left much of its society in ruins .
for centuries , afghanistan was the plaything of foreign powers ’ strategic interests .
in my view , the present situation is above all the consequence of the wars sparked off by the soviet invasion , and of the usa ’s short-sighted policies , both of which gave the taliban real military and political power in afghanistan .
the victims have always been afghan women , children and men – in their millions .
this report , however , is not meant to be about our differences on the past – although we certainly have them – but about our common position that the international community must take responsibility for providing , on a massive scale , political , financial and economic support for the people of afghanistan in shaping a peaceful , democratic and social future for themselves .
this aid , and the financial support provided by the commission in particular , must not be cut back ; it must be stepped up to take account of the prevailing conditions .
it would be irresponsible of the international community , in the shadow of the war in iraq and of the tragic difficulties there , to backtrack on its commitment to afghanistan and weaken its solidarity with its people .
i believe that it is precisely because of the situation in iraq and the unilateralist approach to it that afghanistan must be one of the international community ’s successes , on the basis of the un charter and with a pivotal role for the un .
significant and positive changes have been made since the taliban were ousted .
this has been principally to the credit of the political forces in afghanistan itself .
the international community must , as we do in our report , demand universal human rights , with women ’s rights included among them .
whilst not adopting an imperial approach to doing this , it must be consistent .
despite these – and other – advances , the situation in afghanistan is extremely volatile .
the most pressing problems are the non-existent or minimal security in many regions , the potential for conflict inherent in the unbroken military might of warlords , governors and drug traffickers ; the disarmament process has ground to a halt , it is proving difficult to demobilise soldiers from the private armies and reintegrate them into society , the taliban are regrouping in some parts of the south and south-east of the country and there has been a dramatic increase in opium poppy cultivation and in drug trafficking .
as these problems must not be allowed to prevent the forthcoming presidential elections being conducted successfully , i appeal to all members of this house , and especially to those belonging to the group of the european people ’s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , not to support the amendments seeking to delete the description of these problems .
were we to do that , we would , i believe , be doing the people of afghanistan no favours , nor would we be doing ourselves any if we want to keep afghanistan as an international policy priority .
let me also remind you in this regard that , when we recently honoured the secretary-general of the un by awarding him and his organisation the sakharov prize , we did so in memory of the un personnel killed in iraq ; the warning of a worsening security situation given as recently as 00 january by <unk> brahimi , who was at the time the un ’s special envoy in afghanistan and is now its special envoy in iraq , must be taken seriously .
i would like to thank all my fellow members of the committee , and all the groups .
i believe that we had a common will to make clear how much afghanistan is a priority .
many thanks also to the eu commission , to its staff in kabul and to <unk> vendrell , its special representative there .
. madam president , i would like to apologise to the honourable member at the outset for missing the first minute of his speech .
but i would like to say how much i agreed with the rest of it , particularly what he said about the continuing priority that we must give to afghanistan .
i also agree very strongly with what he said about the commitment , the dedication and the courage of some of those who are implementing our programmes in afghanistan .
i very much welcome this opportunity to discuss afghanistan in the week before i go there again and in the run-up to the most challenging goal set in the bonn agreement of 0000 – the free and fair election of a democratic government in afghanistan .
there was enormous optimism at bonn about building a strong and democratic afghanistan , and delivering a peace dividend to the whole population .
since then there have been huge strides forward , but there are still formidable challenges ahead of us .
last year i suggested that afghanistan was at a critical crossroads and that the international community should redouble its efforts to help president karzai extend his authority across the country .
it is increasingly clear that this also means stamping out opium poppy production .
the 0000 un opium poppy survey makes extremely disturbing reading : not only has production risen by 0 % from the bumper levels seen in 0000 , but cultivation has spread into new areas – it now affects almost 00 % of provinces .
this pernicious trade – valued at about eur 0.0 billion – undermines the efforts to build a functioning plural democratic state and also fuels ongoing instability and conflict .
but before discussing how the international community is working with the afghan government to tackle this , i would like to highlight what afghanistan has achieved in the last twelve months .
firstly , a new constitution – which recognises women as equal to men – has been agreed by the constitutional loya jirga .
next , the process of disarmament , demobilisation and reintegration has started , and there have been some encouraging early results on the reduction of heavy arms in kabul and the panshir valley .
there has also been a start to the election registration process , though we need to speed up the pace .
on the economic front , gdp growth raced ahead by 00 % in 0000 , with a figure of 00 % expected in 0000 .
the new currency introduced in late 0000 has remained stable and the afghan government has succeeded in increasing the flow of tax revenues to kabul .
the international community has also continued ' to do more ' than we promised at tokyo .
total european union commitments in 0000 exceeded eur 000 million , of which just over eur 000 million came from the commission .
as in 0000 , over 00 % of the commission ’s support has been contracted in year , which is an impressive track record by any standards .
the commission ’s development programme has ensured that health services are delivered in six provinces , covering 00 % of the population ; travel times on the <unk> road have already been cut by up to half , and work to fully reconstruct the road is now beginning .
key public sector workers – including doctors , teachers and the police – are back at work .
the rural economy continues to grow , reflecting the provision of improved seed , animal vaccination and the widespread rehabilitation of irrigation structures .
de-mining continues to enable people to return to their own homes .
in addition , funding from echo of eur 000 million has helped to support the return of 0.0 million refugees to afghanistan since 0000 .
however , afghanistan ’s future depends critically on security .
the escalating violence in 0000 has , as the honourable member said , claimed the lives of aid workers , isaf troops and many afghan citizens .
it has left large parts of the south and south-east off limits for international staff .
by the end of 0000 , eur 00 million of commission projects in high-risk areas had been temporarily suspended .
we must recognise that insecurity and burgeoning opium poppy production are two sides of the same coin .
without better security , reconstruction will certainly stall , and we will find ourselves struggling to hold open and credible elections .
so i strongly welcome member states ' engagement in the provincial reconstruction teams , as well as their continued support to isaf .
i strongly hope that nato will be able to provide more troops .
i also welcome the role that france , germany , italy and the united kingdom are playing in helping the afghan government to build an efficient army , police force , and judicial system , as well as to implement an effective <unk> policy .
without stronger institutions and better law enforcement , we will get nowhere in the fight against drugs .
this is exactly why the commission committed an extra eur 00 million to support the police in late 0000 , and why we will continue to play our part in delivering security , including tackling opium production .
as i am sure the house is aware , in may 0000 the afghan government adopted a robust <unk> policy embracing alternative livelihoods , institution building , effective law enforcement and demand reduction .
the commission has worked closely with the afghan government , the uk – the lead donor on <unk> – and the un to help develop and implement this strategy .
in particular , in 0000 the commission committed eur 0 million to promote alternative livelihoods in the eastern region ; eur 0 million to reinforce border control along the <unk> border ; and eur 00.0 million to support the police in delivering effective law enforcement across afghanistan .
in addition , the wider eur 000 million committed for rural development for 0000-0000 will help to provide long-term legitimate employment for those currently involved in poppy production .
this underlines the huge importance we attach to curbing the drug economy .
i have asked commission services to report back on how this will be taken forward following the drugs conference a few days ago on 0 and 0 february .
i hope to have substantive discussions on this when i return to kabul with the ministerial troika next week .
building a secure afghanistan will not be achieved overnight .
we all know that the road ahead is far from easy .
but we cannot afford to let reconstruction fail in afghanistan and it is critical that the international community underlines its strong and continued support for president karzai at the upcoming international conference .
i would like to finish by thanking this house for its unwavering commitment to afghanistan , especially as regards the budget .
i look forward to building on this over the coming year and to informing the house , in due course , of the conclusions i arrive at after my next visit to afghanistan .
. – madam president , as we all know , afghanistan is a country with more problems than it has mountains and valleys .
it is home to over 00 different ethnic groups , among them <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , who co-exist in an equilibrium that has developed over history , but is very unstable .
it is thus clear to us all that afghanistan ’s problems can be resolved only if proposed solutions and aid programmes are in harmony with afghan culture and history .
as the rapporteur said , the situation of women in afghanistan is particularly tragic .
the rate of maternal mortality is among the highest in the world ; that is also the case for deaths of infants and children .
according to official estimates the incidence of illiteracy among afghan women stands at 00 % .
i believe that the position of women can be improved only if we involve the men .
women cannot be helped without persuading their husbands , fathers , brothers and their clan chiefs as well .
if we want to help afghan women , we have to respect their culture , and , in a country in which women have endured years of oppression , it is the men to whom it has to be explained that , if things are good for their wives and children , then they will be all right too and so society as a whole is better off .
as has been said , women and men must be accorded the same rights .
it is also important that we should build schools for girls – and for boys too – so that there can be some changes in the way they think .
reference has been made to the afghan constitution , which accords equal rights to women and men , and which prohibits discrimination of any kind .
as it gets involved , the european union should continue to respect all this and allow its aid measures to benefit the population as a whole .
i wish to thank the rapporteur for his good cooperation on this issue and am behind both him and the commission in their conviction that afghanistan must continue to be a priority on our political agenda if the people who live there are to be helped .
– madam president , i would first of all like to thank mr brie for his report , which has given us a fair picture of the situation in afghanistan , one also very similar to that which we saw together on the ground when we visited last june , under the clear guidance of mr morillon .
since 0000 and following the fall of the taliban , afghanistan , with the aid of the european union and with international assistance , has had to face numerous challenges in order to ensure , on the one hand , its physical reconstruction and , on the other , its political reconstruction .
i am clearly delighted with the adoption of a new constitution for afghanistan , on 0 january , by the loya jirga .
this new constitution marks a step forward on the road to democracy , as well as being a fundamental condition for the organisation of the future presidential and legislative elections .
in order for the reconstruction to become a reality , however , and for the political process to be a success , a secure environment is necessary , so that the governmental bodies , the agents of international assistance and civil society can combine their efforts to reconstruct the country 's infrastructures and civil institutions .
there will be no reconstruction without security .
that is why we must support the establishment of future provincial reconstruction teams , <unk> , which should soon be deployed outside kabul .
these teams will have the task of ensuring security , but also helping in the reconstruction of the country .
our support must extend to the process of disarmament , demobilisation and reintegration of former combatants into civilian life .
finally , we must support the afghan government in its fight against opium growing , with a view to helping it to find effective alternative solutions .
we must be aware that opium production has increased by 0 % since 0000 , which means that the country is the world 's biggest supplier with 00 % of world production .
furthermore , the european union and the international community must continue to actively support the numerous ngos which , despite the climate of insecurity , provide considerable assistance to the afghan population .
within this humanitarian framework , we must encourage implementation of prevention centres and help centres for women , expectant mothers and children .
in fact , even though we must take pleasure in the reference to equal treatment in the new constitution , we all know that the situation of women is fragile and that respect for their fundamental rights will only be achieved with the help of the international community and as a result of intensive information and education campaigns .
afghanistan needs financial aid and logistical support from the european union now more than ever .
the democratic process has begun , but it remains fragile .
it is important that the commission quickly mobilises the necessary resources to ensure effective financial aid .
that is why i believe that the creation of the european agency for reconstruction in afghanistan , similar to the one implemented in kosovo , should receive our full support .
in summary , i would like to remind you that we owe a debt to afghanistan .
for many years we have been absent when that country needed us .
it is now our responsibility to do everything to help afghanistan finally live in peace .
– madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , unlike iraq , the occupation of afghanistan rests on a solid legal basis .
the united nations security council agreed to the military action aimed at eliminating the terrorist bases where the attacks against the united states in kenya , in yemen , in new york and in washington had been promoted .
also unlike secular iraq , the afghanistan of the taliban had taken the form of a retrograde clerical state in which one of the worst forms of repression consisted of reducing women to the status of <unk> .
despite these clear differences , there are certain similarities between the economic and political <unk> of iraq and of afghanistan .
as in iraq , in afghanistan there is also increasing insecurity , which obliges civilian and military personnel , both indigenous and foreign , to dedicate much of their efforts to their own protection .
afghanistan and iraq are both countries with a tribal structure where local bosses and ethnic and religious leaders only want to take the biggest slice of the national cake .
in the past , national unity was only guaranteed by means of a dictatorship , and foreigners or occupying forces are not considered as allies unless they serve the interests of a certain clan chief .
but as time passes , their presence is becoming more and more embarrassing , and at any time irritation may turn to hate , with a war of liberation just around the corner .
the brie report on afghanistan brings us face to face with this reality by reminding us of certain essential truths , including the need to speed up the pace of reform and reconstruction .
it rightly criticises the ambiguities of the new constitution adopted by the tribal grand council , particularly with regard to the restriction of freedom of expression and the situation of women .
when in 0000 we still see the shadows of women imprisoned in their burkas wandering amongst the ruins and the misery , the advantages over the previous regime are not at all obvious .
the challenge of nation building is far from being won .
nevertheless , like our rapporteur i believe that , for the moment , the united nations , the european union and nato have no choice but to continue their efforts to apply great courage to constructing a democratic afghanistan which respects the rights of men and women .
it is essential to establish decentralised institutions and the withdrawal of foreign troops .
it is then up to afghanistan to take control of its own destiny .
madam president , commissioner , rapporteur , i would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on his magnificent report on afghanistan , a country which was in the headlines in autumn 0000 .
the taliban regime was destroyed at that time , but that involved a genuine civil war and consequently exiles , displaced persons and a series of <unk> of the country ’s structures .
what is the situation today ?
afghanistan is a country that needs not just political and social reconstruction but also economic reconstruction .
i would like to mention the report which the european union 's special representative in afghanistan , <unk> vendrell , presented to the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy around a year ago .
he had the experience of having been a united nations delegate to afghanistan and he described to us the lack of security in the majority of the territory .
today afghanistan has an extremely serious problem with the drugs trade .
the trade is estimated , as commissioner patten has said , to stand at usd 0.0 million per year , which is equivalent to approximately half of afghanistan 's gross domestic product .
we hear about 00 000 to 00 000 hectares of cultivation by the bosses who control the territory , cultivation which is not restricted to raw production , since there are also ‘ refining ’ plants so that the drug can be exported directly .
according to the report of the united nations office on drugs and crime ( <unk> ) , two-thirds of the world ’s heroin is produced in afghanistan .
this naturally creates serious problems in the country and , in this regard , i hope the support of the european union and the international community can continue with a view to eradicating consumption as well , which , as the commissioner has said , is the other face of the existing insecurity .
– madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would first of all like to thank our rapporteur for the very complete nature of his report .
it contains absolutely everything we may wish to find , and so it is a pleasure to read and support it .
i would like to take this opportunity to stress that we have made women the emblem of the oppression of the afghan people .
we have made women the emblem of the fight against the taliban .
will we make women the emblem of the reconstruction of afghanistan ?
that is not certain and therefore – as was said on comparing the situation in afghanistan with that in iraq just now – at times of war or liberation , in certain countries , the issue of women arises and becomes particularly acute .
in this regard , the situation of iraqi women is alarming .
so why do we not focus on the issue of women today in afghanistan ?
commissioner , the committee on women 's rights and equal opportunities has had an exchange of letters with you in relation to the attention paid to the issue of women within the framework of reconstruction and in relation to the proportion of aid earmarked by the european union for this issue .
we wanted 00 % .
i realise that this is enormous and that the figure is perhaps rather arbitrary .
in fact , it appears that 0 % is allocated to this chapter .
mainstreaming , above all in the field of health , certainly plays its role to the full , and so we are not going to talk about figures .
having said that , what really amazes me , as well as the scant importance attached to the issue of women , is above all the absence of an education dossier in the commission 's work and in the budget lines proposed .
everybody knows that the issue of education , and in particular the education of girls , is essential within the context of women as an emblem of reconstruction .
that was the first comment i wanted to make .
the second is that we are certainly very happy with the mention of the principle of equality between men and women in the constitution .
we ourselves are fighting , in this house , for this principle to be present in the european constitution .
it follows that this issue does not only arise over in afghanistan , but here as well .
we are very well aware , here , that a principle is not sufficient , that it needs to be applied .
we are happy with what has just happened in morocco in relation to women 's rights , but we are waiting for it to be applied .
the same is clearly true for afghanistan as it is for us .
madam president , the excellent report by mr brie needs little comment .
in my opinion , it gives a good account of the problems with the new constitution .
it makes it clear that there are good reasons for possibly delaying the elections by a few months , and emphasises once again the need to further improve the situation of women .
the tragedy is , however , that , with this report in our hands and the commission ’s good intentions , we have sadly found ourselves in a position where we may well be full of good intentions and have excellent plans , but neither the european parliament nor even the european commission has any influence on the circumstances under which those plans have to be carried out , namely the lack of security .
there is a growing number of reports from ngos stating that twelve aid workers were killed last year , for example .
a growing number of reports from ngos reveal that there is a very large number of good projects that they are unable to carry out .
the commissioner , too , referred to eur 00 million of projects that , sadly , cannot be carried out owing to the lack of security .
this week , we have once more seen the newspapers full of splendid plans for rapid reaction forces .
that is great when it comes to preventing bloodshed in africa , but it must not be at the expense of less sexy projects , so to speak , such as the difficult development work in afghanistan .
after all , the member states of the european union now have a good deal to say for themselves in the way of promises , magnificent things that should be done , but soldiers are not going there , they are going there far too little , and that is the key problem .
i believe that there are hardly any fellow members from the group of the european people ’s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats still here , but i should like to call them to account on a mistake they made in december , in my view .
they convinced parliament that we should cut the aid to afghanistan – yes , you heard right – because drug trafficking is not being tackled .
the fact that drug trafficking is not being tackled is a direct consequence of the omission on the part of eu member states to send any troops to afghanistan , which contributes to dependence on warlords for the maintenance of order by such troops as are there , and consequently makes those troops reluctant to tackle opium trafficking .
we must avoid a situation where we fail to keep our promises again , where afghanistan sinks into an opium economy , led by warlords , and – my greatest concern – where the hopes of many afghans , particularly afghan women , are dashed once again .
we must not allow this to happen .
madam president , commissioner , very recently , a thought-provoking analysis of the political situation in afghanistan appeared in the with the headline : ‘ afghanistan : the gulf between report and reality ’ .
in it , the author , a widely travelled veteran afghanistan journalist , turns the common western image of kabul and its environs on its head .
ladies and gentlemen , commissioner , you can be assured that the present report has prompted me to reflect on this a good deal .
i should like to summarise the article for you , therefore , and add a question about our strategy in afghanistan .
i also hope to give the article to the commissioner later on , and that he has time to peruse it .
this journalist , john jennings , <unk> the spectre of the afghan countryside as an oriental wild west on the basis of his own observations .
with a few localised exceptions , he sees a safe , peaceful society ; in short , no local warlords constantly making life unbearable for each other and the population .
on the contrary , he sees encouraging signs of reconstruction , and also the return of hundreds of thousands of afghan refugees from neighbouring pakistan and iran .
in the opinion of jennings , that huge majority of ordinary afghans living in areas not actively contested by taliban remnants have it better today than at any time since 0000 .
interim president karzai should have every interest in this .
to look at the scenario jennings describes , however , the reverse seems to be true : with the help of isaf and nato , the technocrats in kabul are seeking the military and political removal of the <unk> groups in the provinces .
it is precisely that <unk> agenda that gives rise to the very real danger of a general revolt against a regime imposed from outside : an afghan tradition .
in jennings ’s view , it would be much more beneficial to the future of afghanistan as a nation state to construct carefully and gradually from the bottom up , and to achieve political consensus among the regional authorities , which do , after all , sanction a weak central authority .
interfering with this fragile process would give the taliban and their anti-western pakistani patrons a second chance .
this would mean an out-and-out defeat for the west in the fight against islamic terrorism .
paragraphs 00 and 00 of this report reveal that my colleague mr brie recognises the acute problem , this area of tension .
unfortunately , he does not enter into a more in-depth exploration of this fundamental problem regarding afghanistan ’s future as a nation : this issue is subordinated .
we shall have to make do with that .
what are the views of the council and the commission in this regard ?
i should like to bring this article to the attention of commissioner patten , particularly given his plans to set off for kabul in the near future .
i shall hand it to you later on .
after all , no small matter is involved : a fair , sensible international strategy towards a breeding ground for international terrorist networks .
– madam president , one reason why afghanistan is a topic of crucial importance is the need to demonstrate that not only can terrorism with state links be defeated , but that peace can then be won too .
things are not looking too good in afghanistan at the moment .
it is rumoured that taliban groups in the south are making mighty advances , one hears – as the russian defence minister , mr ivanov , said in munich last week – that the cultivation of drugs has increased nine times over since the war began , and we see how soldiers from europe , who are supposed to be working for the country ’s future security , are unable to take action against it .
it appears that they were watching over the drug routes along which the drugs find their way to europe and to our children .
to my mind , this is a very problematic situation and is the reason why it is urgently necessary that we should make every effort to facilitate the establishment of the rule of law and of democracy under a strong and guaranteed central power that also takes account of ethnic differences and of diversity .
there will be no peace in afghanistan for as long as – as has been the case – the provision of aid and the division of power are one-sided , with the <unk> losing out .
this , i believe , is something else that we have to stress .
the elections need to be properly prepared , so that it is clear who is entitled to vote and so that the elections may gain legitimacy , and the new constitution needs to be used in order for this balance of power to be achieved .
the new constitution brings with it both opportunities and problems , for it makes sharia law possible .
while the courts still have judges as conservative as the present ones , nothing that comes out of them will be acceptable to us in terms of our view of what the rule of law means .
this , i believe , is why we must , over the coming weeks and months , devote much attention and a great deal of effort to looking after this country .
– madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of my group i would like to thank mr brie for the wonderful work he has done , providing us with a clear and accurate picture of the reconstruction work that afghanistan has to undertake and the challenges it must face in the coming years .
above all , though , i would like to thank him for the particular attention he has paid to respect for women ’s rights , for the vigilance he has asked us to show because of the fragility of what has been gained .
a great deal of progress has indeed been made , at least in the constitutional text : political power exercised by constitutional representatives , representation of women , equality between men and women written in black and white , respect for linguistic diversity considered as an asset and not as a threat and , finally , respect for the united nations charter and the universal declaration of human rights .
even if an islamic state is declared , i believe it would be remarkable for that part of the world .
this challenge is , however , a shared one , faced by both the international community and the european union .
we must respect our own commitments to ensure this democratic transition and it is essential that we are clearly present in order to support all the processes to put in place the necessary structures for civil and economic reform in afghanistan .
in fact , the climate of insecurity must not destabilise the efforts made , and hence the unquestionable need for a multiannual framework programme which would allow both the structuring of the judicial system and the establishment of specific reconciliation regulations as well as an education system .
it also seems to me to be essential that the whole process of pacification should go hand-in-hand with the process of economic and social reconstruction .
having said that , we are wary of the slow pace of this reconstruction , since it could jeopardise the stability necessary for the development of the country .
we have made many commitments , we must fulfil them quickly and , above all , understand that the least delay on our part risks being exploited by others to establish their hold on fragile structures , with the help of funds originating from drug trafficking .
we must also work on making the progress made in favour of the population visible so that the people do not sink into despair after 00 years of war .
if we fail to meet this challenge , we could lose not only our credibility , but also an area of peace on which stability in the region depends .
madam president , my congratulations to the rapporteur for a very fine report , which i know we will all support .
i should also like to thank the commissioner and his team for their fine work in the field .
i remind colleagues that in october 0000 the oppression of afghan women was highlighted globally .
the assumption was made that the removal of the taliban regime would ease the women 's plight .
today , two and a half years on , amnesty claims that the international community and the afghan administration have been unable to protect the rights of women .
rape and sexual violence by members of the occupying armed forces are still widespread .
in the western province of herat , <unk> decrees are still widespread and , as a result of this oppression , more women in afghanistan are committing suicide now than they were under the taliban regime .
human rights watch reports many sexual assaults against children .
despite the rhetoric , the creation of the women 's ministry , the karzai government pursues <unk> policies , and there is no legal protection , while older legal systems still in position prohibit them from getting help .
women 's resistance to the regime still has to work underground .
the revolutionary association of the women of afghanistan is forbidden to open an office and distribute its magazine .
people caught reading its literature are still in physical danger .
commissioner patten said that afghanistan had reached a crossroads .
i believe , as do amnesty , human rights watch and the revolutionary association of the women of afghanistan , that the government has taken a wrong turn and that the position of women is worse than it was before .
madam president , the situation today is the result of continual intervention of one form or another by the americans and their allies over recent years , both to overturn the popular democratic regime in afghanistan and impose their mercenary taliban and to directly invade and occupy afghanistan militarily on the pretext of fighting terrorism .
unfortunately , in the proposed motion , all this is passed over in silence .
not a word is said about the criminal responsibility of the americans and , in essence , support is given to the <unk> karzai government , the credentials of which , as we know , are non-existent .
the report accepts these interventions and tries to propose solutions without disputing the present situation .
it considers the transfer of the responsibility of the occupying forces to nato to be positive and proposes new funding which will strengthen its position in the controlled areas , while there is no guarantee whatsoever for the management of these funds for the benefit of the afghan people , especially women .
it welcomes the new constitution approved by the loya jirga , while at the same time highlighting its negative aspects , which make it unacceptable .
it nurtures futile hopes of democratic elections , while recognising that the conditions for them are not in place .
at the same time , while finding that today the main source of income is from the cultivation of opium , the primary revenue from which goes to local warlords , it does not concern itself at all with its further movements in the world and the involvement of the cia in it .
that is why , although we congratulate and thank the rapporteur , andré brie , on the huge effort he has made , we unfortunately cannot support his report , because it is clear from the foregoing that the report does not face the facts .
the afghan people , victims of the new order , will be able to find their way if they resist the forces propelling it , either in the form of religious fanaticism or under the cloak of a poor copy of a <unk> bourgeois democracy , the military interventions and the occupation .
we must support them in this fight .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , firstly and most importantly , my thanks to the rapporteur for his excellent report , which gives a good overview of the many problems afghanistan is still having to face .
allow me to examine the commissioner ’s communication in greater depth , however .
commissioner , you have overwhelmed us a little with figures , and i admit that they are impressive .
however , i am wondering about the following . we have here a country which is in need of reconstruction , which must first and foremost reconstruct itself , and an economic basis is a prerequisite for this .
as you emphasise , the fight against opium cultivation is a very important aspect , but , in all the various measures forming part of the strategy to combat that opium cultivation , i have not actually heard what alternatives the producers have .
i have seen documentaries showing how the military descend upon farming communities and destroy everything for the sake of opium cultivation .
i do understand the necessity of this , but how do we mean for it to stop if people do not have an alternative income ?
the same goes for the warlords .
how are they ever to stop being warlords if they are constantly being supplied with money from the opium economy ?
finally , i had actually wanted to speak about women , but i cannot because my time is up .
i should like to give one example , however : the construction of a women ’s centre in kabul on which work had only taken a few months .
it was built , it was inundated with women looking for education and health care , it was a place where they could take off their burkas in peace .
it is possible ; why is it , then , that we are so slow to produce results with international resources ?
madam president , i wish to begin by congratulating mr brie on his excellent report .
i would now like to address commissioner patten : there are two issues that i would like him to raise .
in november 0000 , mr karzai 's government allowed the enforcement of a 0000 law banning married women from the classroom which , according to the deputy education minister , led to the expulsion of about two to three thousand women .
could you raise the issue of this law enforcement ?
article 0 of the afghan constitution states that : ' no law can be contrary to the beliefs and provisions of the sacred religion of islam . '
this language – designed to secure a relatively smooth approval of the new afghan constitution – may entail high costs for women in the future .
the control of education by religious authorities is definitely a very alarming signal and an issue that should be raised .
many reports confirm that in several regions of afghanistan there is no security for women , and education for girls is under threat .
00 attacks have been documented on girls ' schools since september 0000 , ranging from rocket attacks to setting schools on fire or their forced closure by <unk> .
their effect is devastating .
according to the un development programme , the gross enrolment ratio at primary level has been most recently calculated as being 00 % for boys , with a corresponding rate for girls of just 0 % .
the unicef programme ' back to school ' , launched in march 0000 , gave rise to great expectations .
more than three million children – one-third of them girls – flooded the classrooms in afghanistan .
however , in kandahar , leaflets were distributed with the message ' stop sending your women to offices and daughters to school .
it spreads indecency and vulgarity .
stand ready for the consequences if you do not heed the advice . '
then , after five months , these violent attacks on girls ' schools began .
we know the immense challenges that confront the afghan transitional authority today .
the european union and the international community should strongly support economic , social and political reconstruction .
however , it is imperative that security for women throughout the country is a priority for both donors and the afghan government .
if we fail in that , the future will be very grim .
madam president , sadly afghanistan has been slightly forgotten about in the aftermath of the iraq war .
a lot of resources will be needed to rebuild the country , and the eu is a large donor ; in my view this entitles us to lay down significant political conditions , including demanding progress in human rights , particularly women 's rights to education and access to the workforce .
i also regret the new constitution , which gives primacy to sharia law over international , un , civil , and political treaty obligations : this may cause conflict over areas such as female lapidation .
i am concerned at the lack of security and the necessary concentration of isa forces in kabul to protect the government .
there have been significant <unk> of taliban and al-qa ' ida forces bent on murdering international aid workers in the provinces , which will set back progress .
i do not believe president musharraf is doing enough to rein in terrorist groups in pakistan 's tribal areas and north-west frontier provinces ; this is ostensibly because islamabad 's writ does not run to these parts .
more must be done if he is to have credibility in the fight against international terrorism .
i was delighted that the <unk> gold treasures were recovered and i would like to see funds devoted to the reconstitution of the national museum in kabul as a symbol of national pride under the patronage of the royal family , which is a benign uniting force in the land .
lastly , on the subject of the opium crop , my amendment has suggested consideration being given to buying and burning or using it for medical purposes as a <unk> , as a cheaper alternative to drug enforcement measures by the international organisations dedicated to fighting the drug trade and business .
it would save the international community a lot of money to burn it and pay the farmers , instead of spending many billions of dollars fighting the drug trafficking trade .
madam president , the situation in afghanistan is of great interest to this house .
this important report , in the context of the development of democracy in afghanistan , is highly topical .
as the report emphasises , the situation since the end of the taliban regime has improved , but additional efforts need to be made .
for example , as many have said this morning , the situation of women must be highlighted .
literacy is still unbelievably low , with only a 00 % to 00 % literacy rate among women .
only one-third of school children are girls .
they are often held back from returning to school .
and even if some of these women go to school they face violence just for attending .
these trends are strongest outside kabul , in the south and east of the country , where the situation of women is not so well known but is much worse than in the political centre .
the constitution , drawn up in january , specifically recognises the equality between men and women .
00 % of the seats in the house of the people are reserved for women , yet it remains uncertain that this provision , along with others establishing rights for women , will help to implement women 's rights properly or help women get elected in the coming election .
many members have talked about the issue of drugs .
we live in a world where a poppy grown in afghanistan can end up being illegally sold as heroin in scotland .
the human suffering caused by the drugs problem and its links to crime in our communities concerns us all .
that is why we should support the afghan national drug control strategy , which sets the target of complete elimination of poppy growing by 0000 .
i am pleased that the uk government plans to deploy an enhanced drugs team to kabul and kandahar by the end of the year and has made gbp 00 million available , over three years , for law enforcement , capacity-building , alternative livelihoods for those who are involved in poppy cultivation , and <unk> initiatives .
we must ensure that capacity for effective public administration continues to improve at central and provincial levels .
madam president , the isaf troops and many other aid organisations are doing a lot of good in afghanistan .
their work is , however , being sabotaged by the presence of the american forces .
last year , i had the opportunity , together with an eu delegation , to visit the us headquarters in <unk> .
it was clear that the americans have no plans whatsoever regarding women ’s rights , democracy or the fight against drugs .
by their own admission , what interests them is that each government in afghanistan should acknowledge the us troops ’ right to return , if they ever leave the country .
that is quite revealing in terms of what is at issue here .
when we were in <unk> , there was something we did not get to see and about which an american journalist told us , namely the prison in <unk> , in comparison with which reports from guantánamo bay seem like accounts of a sunday school picnic .
she had learned that , at that time in any case , there were several hundred prisoners in the jail at <unk> , exposed to torture .
they were not being hit , but they were forced to stand naked for hours , day in and day out , under constant questioning .
finally , two prisoners died , and the journalist got an honest american doctor to state clearly in the death certificate that the cause of death was murder .
it nonetheless took several months before the new york times dared to publish the relevant article .
that is how sensitive it is to acknowledge that in afghanistan , just as in many other places , the american soldiers are gangsters who use every means available to defend american interests but who are completely indifferent to the local population .
let us remove the americans and replace them with reasonable people from the isaf and aid organisations .
there are so many others who can make constructive efforts .
the americans are merely making a bad situation worse .
– madam president , the report on afghanistan is to be welcomed in so far as it demonstrates that land of the hindu kush , having become a focus of international attention in the aftermath of 00 september 0000 , will not again be forgotten , and that the european union is maintaining its financial and political commitment in order to help achieve stability .
the essential picture painted by the report is a very pessimistic one , which , in my view , takes too little account of the positive elements , one of which was , without a doubt , the loya jirga ’s adoption of the constitution last december .
the constitution is primarily intended to strengthen central government , without which this country , divided between ethnic groups and torn asunder by decades of warfare and soviet occupation , has scarcely any chance of building itself into a nation or of normal development .
the next thing needed is democratic elections , which will , in this country , be a difficult process .
even though the preparatory work has got underway too late , the elections should be held as soon as possible , on the presupposition that they will reinforce the stabilisation process .
i am aware that the americans are insisting on the elections being held in june , but , if the situation is to be kept calm , and the conditions for a more or less democratic election created , it is not absolutely necessary to stick to this date .
we said in august that it would be no disaster if they were to be held rather later .
all the other measures intended to help pacify the country can be compared with the proverbial glass of water , which is either half full or half empty .
the security situation is as dire as it was before .
the militant taliban have apparently re-established themselves in the south-east , and the americans are not excluding the possibility of using land troops in a spring offensive .
although the extension of the isaf ’s operations to the areas outside kabul is to be welcomed , its mandate is so limited that german troops stationed in <unk> – the safest area , incidentally – are in fact simply onlookers while opium smuggling continues to be one of the country ’s main sources of revenue , which , in its turn , has made afghanistan the world ’s largest producer of opium .
the opium trade is in full swing , still helping to maintain the warlords and their armies , and that is one of the main problems .
mr president , first , may i apologise to the house for missing much of this debate , but unfortunately i had to be present at the stoa panel to vote to try and prevent the suppression of a scientific report at the behest of europe 's chocolate multinationals on inedibles in food .
doubly unfortunately , the vote was lost by 00 votes to 0 .
on afghanistan , firstly i congratulate mr brie on his report on a difficult subject in a difficult country .
i was privileged to be part of the delegation from the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy to afghanistan in june 0000 .
it was clear that security is the paramount issue .
unfortunately , the glass increasingly seems to be half-empty , rather than half-full .
the occupying coalition troops and the united states sit out their days in their fixed and mobile <unk> , when on the streets they exhibit the same heavy-handed style currently displayed in iraq .
isaf has a footprint centred on kabul , limiting its operations to 0 % of afghanistan 's land area .
the rest of the country is effectively abandoned to feuding warlords who monopolise revenues and dispense arbitrary justice in their private prisons , making president karzai at times little more than the united <unk> mayor of kabul .
after the marines killed three afghan national army soldiers in a <unk> exchange , isaf stepped in to broker peace between the two groups , ostensibly on the same side . yet for many in the afghan national army , the isaf and the united states troops are merely all flowers from the same garden .
campaigns without resources to spread isaf 's presence outside kabul are wishful and <unk> thinking .
no-one seems able or willing to find the money to increase the number of troops – some 00 000 would be needed for nationwide coverage .
in the south the main targets for the remnants of the taliban are foreigners , but without reconstruction work , the temptation for the local population is to see the situation as no better , if not worse , than under the taliban .
many people argue that large sections of the taliban could be brought back into civic society , but to do that would be to shift the social centre of gravity back towards an islamic conservatism that bodes ill for women 's emancipation .
human rights is important , particularly the situation of women .
formal rights may well be given but they are unlikely to play out in the villages .
the best hope for the future may be universal education , which will not change current attitudes but rather those of the next generation .
the united states and the eu are pushing bottom lines that in practice are probably <unk> .
as the united nations special representative said , if you are trying to introduce western-style democracy in afghanistan , you are wasting your time .
mr president , i wish to thank the rapporteur , mr brie for a very well written and important description of the position in afghanistan and of what we should do to improve it .
i have four points i wish to make to parliament and to commissioner patten .
the first concerns drugs .
while the international community works to prevent drug abuse , afghanistan ’s illegal opium production discourages individual governments in the surrounding area from contributing financially to the reconstruction of the country .
according to an investigation by the un body for drugs control and crime prevention , afghanistan was responsible in 0000 for three quarters or 00 % of the world ’s total production of illegal opium .
that is , to say the least , deeply worrying .
the second point concerns the position of women .
the antidemocratic and islamicist taliban regime was guilty during its time in power of the most deliberate violation of women ’s rights in modern times .
the regime introduced a gender apartheid that totally denied women ’s identity .
the taliban regime is now gone but , in very many respects , its view of women still prevails in afghanistan .
the country ’s authorities , the international community and the eu must therefore make every possible effort to change this view .
the third point concerns freedom of religion . afghanistan ’s first constitution following the fall of the taliban dictatorship is cause for concern , given certain wordings about the dominant role of islamic law , about restrictions upon certain human rights and individual freedoms and about restrictions upon women ’s rights .
the last point concerns the education system .
we in the european parliament want to see an open education system as an alternative to the <unk> or the koran schools that operate as strongholds of muslim extremism and of a culture of hatred in which taliban militants are recruited .
mr president , i would like to congratulate mr brie on an excellent report .
i also had the honour of being on the delegation to afghanistan .
i know that some people have congratulated me on being a first in a number of things .
another first that i now count is the fact that i was sitting having tea with some of the biggest drug dealers and drug producers in the world .
i am particularly addressing my remarks to the honourable member who , i know , is going to disappear into the sunset before too long , but maybe he can make a great contribution to european safety if in his few months remaining he takes on board some of the issues i was talking about .
the total value of the poppy crop at the farm gate in afghanistan is estimated at eur 000 million .
its heroin street value is estimated at eur 00.0 billion .
the amount of revenue spent by member state police forces , customs services and anti-drug squads to control heroin imports and use alone adds up to eur 0 billion per year .
the number of arrests for drug offences throughout the eu is around 000 000 people per year .
00 000 people are imprisoned every year for drug offences , leading to annual custodial costs of eur 0.0 billion .
we need an alternative development approach for afghanistan which integrates eu drug policy into its development policy .
we have to offer the rural population economically viable and steady means of earning an income .
therefore is it not far better to stop this trade at the point of growing , rather than the point of consumption or distribution ?
if we do this , we will save eur 0 billion in policing costs alone , and eur 0.0 billion in custodial costs .
i propose to the honourable member that we manage this transition , from poppy growing to fruit growing , as we now do for greek tobacco , which we buy and burn .
a similar exercise could be done for the poppy crop in afghanistan , and i would like the honourable member to take this on board seriously .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at 00 noon .
the next item is the commission statement on reinvigorating eu actions on human rights and democratisation with mediterranean partners .
– mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , my group welcomes the commission ’s statement .
i believe that it is an important step , and can also provide an integrated approach to various policies .
as the commissioner has said , this is about the integration of the barcelona process with the ‘ wider europe ’ strategy and the issues related to the funding of meda and other programmes .
these , i believe , must also include human rights and democracy , for lasting peace can come into being only if the state , civil society , the political forces and parties guarantee , in the long term , deep roots for democracy and the rule of law , which always provides the greatest certainty of peaceful development .
this is of enormous significance for us , not only because of human rights , which should be guaranteed by other means , but also because stabilising regions like this on the basis of democracy and the rule of law is the best security policy we can pursue in our own interests ; we should indeed ensure that stability prevails there in such a way that people have a future and do not fall prey to fundamentalism , as they would otherwise be justified in doing .
this is what underlies many political problems in countries in the middle east , making it more difficult to lead them towards a better future .
it is specifically in matters such as these , commissioner , that i see it as important that non-governmental organisations should be brought on board , but please allow me to comment on what you have just said in your conclusion .
it strikes me as important that – as was previously the case in central and eastern europe – such democracy programmes should increasingly draw on the experience of the european parliament and of its meps , not only by consulting them , but also by involving them in the decision-making process .
whilst i am not defending a breach of the separation of powers , the fact is that we , with our own experience gained from the daily business of building up democracy , parties <unk> democracy , have more knowledge than is to be found in an administrative body , in which people are trained to look at things from a completely different angle , and i do not believe that this is about simply coming up with theoretical concepts that cost a lot of money but produce no results .
it is far more about setting up effective structures on the ground .
perhaps we should revert to this former practice ; it would be an interesting area in which to experiment and see what progress this enables us to make .
may i make a final comment ? in the past , i believe , both the commission and parliament paid insufficient attention to whether or not our resolutions on human rights and democracy were actually implemented .
in this respect , monitoring and implementation were our weak points .
we came up with some tremendous resolutions , and then that was that .
the possibility of checking whether or not anything is done about them seems to me to be acquiring ever-greater importance ; it , too , is tied in with the integrative process of which i spoke at the beginning .
i believe that many agreements should be linked to the establishment of human rights , and that much funding should be linked to the development of democracy , in order thereby to establish checks and balances that make possible the practical application of democracy and human rights , on which stability depends , and saves them from being merely fine-sounding words .
mr president , commissioner patten , it is important that the issue of human rights and democracy is once again brought to the centre of the debate on relations between the european union and the mediterranean countries .
almost ten years on from the barcelona process we note that there is still a serious lack of democracy in these countries , which has also been pointed out in numerous united nations development programme ( undp ) reports .
indeed , we must ask ourselves if the policy that we have implemented to date and , above all , the instruments put forward in this area , were adequate given the ambitious objectives of the barcelona strategy .
article 0 of the clause of the bilateral association agreements has turned out to be broadly insufficient .
i am , however , asking a more complex question : are bilateral agreements adequate instruments for promoting the development of human rights ?
i believe that these agreements have helped to give international recognition to regimes that would otherwise have had no legitimacy .
we need to be very careful about this , and i believe that the commission communication poses this question .
i support the ten points ; the initiative for democracy that the european parliament wants is an interesting instrument because it is one of the few instruments which allows measures to be carried out independent of governments .
indeed , all the others fall within the intergovernmental sphere , even if you are right , commissioner , when you state that we need to remember that part of this dialogue must also involve the ruling classes .
nevertheless , i would like this instrument to be more consistent with the rest of our policies , otherwise there is a risk that it will be a way to legitimise the other policies , which are essentially .
this incentive is , therefore , excellent , it is good for countries prepared to go down this road and it is just as excellent regarding the euro-mediterranean parliamentary assembly , which could have interesting potential .
it is extremely important for the sana’a conference , which has brought the issue to the attention of governments and civil society .
i ask myself , however , if there should not be a permanent and unequivocal push for democracy from the european institutions , which is also based on new instruments .
for example , commissioner , why not try , with these countries , to have a multilateral convention on human rights , which is also based on institutions that are able to guarantee these rights ?
compared to the current situation , this would give rise to a different dynamic .
finally , i tabled an amendment to article 00 , because i think that farming out this policy to an external agency somewhat contradicts the debate that we have had up until now , since it should be the european institutions that have the power to implement this policy .
therefore , as regards financial procedures , should the commission not have instruments that are adapted to implementing these objectives ?
mr president , democracy and human rights in mediterranean countries are still in a wretched state , the main cause being that the authorities never relinquish power and do not even want to share it .
autocratic regimes can only maintain their hold on power by means of repression and by restricting freedom .
the worst hit are the people who are badly governed and lag behind economically and socially .
this forms a breeding ground for radicalism on the part of disaffected people that impacts on not only the region itself , but also the rest of the world .
the european union must do everything in its power to exert a positive influence on the situation , therefore .
the partnerships provide a good framework for this ; one , however , of which we have up to now made insufficient , and insufficiently binding , use .
financial aid alone , without political conditions , will only lead to a deterioration in the situation , and for that reason i welcome this spur to the reinvigoration of policy wholeheartedly .
the commission communication , with its ten priorities , is truly excellent .
many of the proposed actions are in line with the specific suggestions i made in my report on human rights last year .
the intentions and approach are good , but , of course , results are by no means guaranteed .
we are ultimately aiming to induce the regimes to make fundamental changes in their behaviour that they would not have been inclined to make of their own accord .
the new actions must not lead to bureaucratisation , but rather to specific objectives that are tested systematically .
it is very important to give the situation a positive boost .
can the commissioner tell us how our partners have reacted up to now , apart from morocco and jordan , which he has already mentioned ?
can he also explain how the eu ’s approach relates to the policy of the united states with regard to the region ?
to what extent is there transatlantic coordination ?
the proposed spur to action comes not a moment too soon .
further deterioration in the region could have far-reaching consequences .
many regimes say that security is more important than democracy .
this contradiction could hardly be more mistaken .
it is precisely a lack of democracy that makes the situation hopeless and dangerous .
anyone striving for security and prosperity must first safeguard democracy and human rights .
i should like to hear answers from the commissioner to my questions .
– mr president , commissioner , what is making things so very complicated , i believe , is the fact that we can never be sure of anything .
i heard you welcome the efforts of the moroccan authorities .
for my part , i have just read the very recent report of the <unk> which was presented yesterday and which demonstrates the extent to which 00 september has had devastating effects in these countries , taking the form of many arbitrary imprisonments all over the place , which clearly represent a genuine violation of respect for human rights .
so while we welcome the very interesting and noteworthy progress made in relation to the family code , certain extremely worrying elements nevertheless remain .
i say this to demonstrate that the very considerable efforts agreed by the commission and by this parliament – which you stress yourselves – to reinforce all the mechanisms for action and assessment concerning respect for human rights are determined not only by the international context , but also by the relations that the eu ’s member states individually maintain with these different countries .
how many programmes will we need in order to cancel out the disastrous effect of president chirac ’s visit to tunisia , where he stated that there were no human rights problems , and , in the middle of a hunger strike by an eminent lawyer , that the main right is the right to eat ?
how many programmes will we need in order to remedy that ?
we are well aware that , in the evaluation of the association agreements , the constraints of the on the part of the states are terrifying .
we truly need to consolidate the community efforts resulting from the support of the associations , of the ngos , of civil society and , as we know , of the members of this parliament and the commission .
so there are actors who can perhaps overcome that handicap .
but i would like to ask you directly , commissioner , about any responsibility you may have in this regard .
in tunisia , how can we explain that , while the ben ali government is in the process of holding back the funds allocated to the tunisian human rights league , the commission is initiating a clearly nonsensical programme aimed at providing support for media that do not exist , which are shackled , entirely in the hands of ben ali ?
everybody knows that ben ali is going to use this not inconsiderable sum to fund his presidential propaganda .
do you realise that or do you not ?
how is such a thing possible ?
that is something i really wonder about , as it is precisely on us that such a decision depends .
mr president , the european union does indeed have every interest in creating an area of stability , security and democracy on the other side of the mediterranean , and therefore any efforts it devotes towards this are by no means wasted .
much remains to be done , however .
the situation in that region remains volatile .
indeed , aid must not be misused for further tolerating conditions or for keeping regimes in power that have been violating human rights for years .
we , the european union , must not perpetuate any taboos .
major obstacles to the achievement of our objectives include the further rise of islam on the one hand , and the continuing immigration problem on the other .
we must make it clear that further waves of immigration are in the interests of neither maghreb countries nor europe .
those countries certainly do not stand to gain from the brain drain or other such phenomena .
besides , further immigration hinders the integration of the immigrants already present in europe .
we must continue to make an issue of this .
it is a matter of continuing our efforts to bring about greater democracy and stability in these countries , both in their interests and in ours , including in the context of the policy of good neighbourly relations that is now in the pipeline .
mr president , i have taken our vice-president , mr dimitrakopoulos ' chair , just to remind ourselves that democracy in the mediterranean did not begin with this debate .
i thank the commissioner , whose work as governor of hong kong ensured the continuation of the democratic life of that territory , which i hope will spark changes in the wider china .
it is my pleasure to be rapporteur on the communication ' reinvigorating eu actions on human rights and democratisation with mediterranean partners ' .
we welcome the communication and its ten points for action .
we note that it was published in 0000 .
since that time , the meda process has taken on a new lease of life , with the agreements in december to establish the euro-mediterranean parliamentary forum .
in december also , the council , while failing to agree on the european constitution , did at least agree that the paper presented by the commissioner and by the high representative entitled ' strengthening the eu 's relations with the arab world ' would be adopted in march .
we welcome that .
i am also rapporteur on the two regulations dealing with the continuation of the european initiative for democracy and human rights in 0000 and 0000 .
while endorsing the communication on ' reinvigorating eu actions on human rights and democratisation with mediterranean partners ' , we are also examining these two regulations .
the commissioner 's references to the undp report underline the importance attached to it by the commission , but unfortunately the commission needs to put its money where its mouth is . we need to examine very closely the way in which the european union is funding programmes in this region .
for example , he mentioned a figure of eur 000 million for good governance in the meda region .
in fact , in the wider mediterranean , my understanding is that eur 000 million a year is available for good governance .
but of this , only eur 0 million is currently budgeted through the european initiative for democracy and human rights .
reference has been made in this house this morning to forthcoming elections in algeria and tunisia , where very little money is getting through to the ngos and activists who are looking for a free media and the development of human rights .
unfortunately – i have had some experience as the originator of this democracy programme – it is now rather bureaucratic and errs on the side of safety .
the only way of dealing with this is to try and adapt it to the realities of the present situation .
an unstable world to our east and south demands special actions .
having had experience of working in this field in the 0000s with the ex-soviet union , through an external agency which had an agility and freedom to manoeuvre not enjoyed by the commission and the <unk> not available to the council , i can say that , with the advantage of parliament 's involvement , we have a much more effective programme .
i welcome the commissioner 's assertion that he will be open-minded about further suggestions we might make as a parliament .
i intend to bring these forward , especially since i understand this morning that the council has decided to withdraw the regulations as presented and to present them in a new format , thereby delaying yet further the adoption of the regulations .
this debate will continue .
mr president , we are in favour of and support the commission 's communication on reinvigorating eu actions on human rights and democratisation in the southern and eastern mediterranean .
we are convinced that the enormous challenge of developing these neighbouring regions can only be possible , in terms of european responsibilities , if we combine responsibility and management .
in other words , through the sound implementation of association agreements with strong political and cultural impetus , in a context in which the norm is increasingly represented by voices and images of poverty , fanaticism and terrorism rather than by the aims of genuinely moving towards freedom , social cohesion and peace .
we therefore support this initiative and we advocate that in terms of the european union ’s general policy , as far as human rights are concerned , we should not resort to closing our eyes , on the one hand , for the sake of a false , nor , on the other hand , be content with mere condemnations or protests .
we must be ‘ <unk> ’ in our policies towards the countries of the southern and eastern mediterranean . in other words , our priority must always be to consider the consequences of our policies in this regard .
as the commissioner has said quite rightly , there is a strategy which will soon be ten years old – that of the barcelona process – and all we have to do is remember that , since barcelona is an olympic city , the entrance to the commission 's offices should display the motto '' for the development of our euro-mediterranean policy .
– mr president , what is termed the barcelona process certainly has all the sympathy of men and women of good will .
the capital of the catalan nation was indeed worthy of being the place where a policy aimed at building bridges across the mediterranean was launched .
i must mention here in passing the memory of two illustrious catalans who anticipated this policy each in their own way in the middle ages : raymond lull and <unk> <unk> .
i welcome the intelligent and understanding effort implemented by this policy , and in particular in the documents which are the subject of our debate .
nevertheless , given the general situation , i wonder about this policy ’s chances .
in order to fly the flag for democracy and human rights , we must be exemplary .
we are far from it .
as recently as yesterday , lawyers in this lovely city of strasbourg publicly placed a funeral wreath in front of the prefecture mourning the death of the presumption of innocence as a result of a law which has just been voted on in france .
a year ago , a spanish judge ordered the closure of , the only daily newspaper in the basque language , and imprisoned several journalists – some are still in prison .
to this day , one year later , no contradictory debate has been organised to justify this blatant violation of press freedom .
the criminal war waged by the united states against iraq was subject to the active or passive complicity of the majority of member states of the enlarged union .
this horrific wound is still bleeding , and it will do so for a long time .
for many muslims in the world it is an additional humiliation .
this list is unfortunately far from exhaustive .
if we are not careful , the obsession with security and the hijacking of the war against terror for partisan ends will undermine this policy , and many others , despite all the intelligence and good will of those who will try to implement it .
mr president , commissioner patten , ladies and gentlemen , i think that if we want to implement a policy in this area , it is important to know what is happening in the mediterranean and in the arab world .
the signals we are receiving are weak , perhaps superficial , perhaps devised with the ulterior motive of doing nothing at all , but what is not in doubt is that , in the last two years , signals have been sent , which we would do well to pick up on and <unk> say this because i have the impression that there is very little awareness of this in our member states .
mrs flautre who spoke before me has , for example , already highlighted the tunisian issue , with a series of extremely conflicting positions , and perhaps it is not a coincidence that it was two representatives from tunisian civil society that were prevented from taking part in the afore-mentioned sana’a conference : this is the only thing that i was able to notice in the organisation of this conference .
from this point of view , commissioner patten , ladies and gentlemen , i believe that we must stop being excessively prudent because our actions must have credibility .
we lose credibility , for example , when we do not enforce the clauses of article 0 : we are not credible in the eyes of governments – who , in fact , consider us to be relatively malleable partners – nor are we in the eyes of non-governmental actors , whose trust we are losing .
i say this because , for example , we are drawing closer to the meeting for the ratification of the lebanon agreement and i believe , commissioner , that it is important to note , in this house , the lack of progress on the independence of lebanon ’s judiciary and the fact that relations with the european union should be subject to this requirement being met .
aside from individual references to specific positions , i believe that action by the european commission or europe in general is important : there is much demand for europe – perhaps in comparison with the alternative – and great things are expected of it .
the importance of sana’a has been stressed here .
why is it important , commissioner ?
well , it is important because of the format of the conference : governments and non-governmental actors have for the first time found themselves on an equal footing in discussing and wrangling , but also in creating a final statement that , in my opinion , creates the requirements for a consultation process , which perhaps our us friends are less prone to emphasise and less inclined towards .
i believe that it would be an important signal , commissioner , in the context of our discussion , to ensure that sana’a is followed up , in such a way that it does not remain just one of many such events but becomes a process that is monitored .
the involvement of women has also been extraordinary and exceptional vitality came from women ’s organisations , which really must be given assistance .
we therefore have something to work on , commissioner , that has arisen from the consultation we held with our partners and from the texts they have produced , a course of action that cannot be said to be handed down from above , because it has been requested by the partners themselves .
i believe that this merits a very solid follow-up .
mr president , i can sympathise a little with commissioner patten who has to listen to one speech after another without being able to make comments after any of the speakers .
perhaps this type of debate or , rather , series of monologues that we have in the european parliament could be a touch more lively .
as one of the last speakers , i hope that the commissioner will nonetheless manage to listen to one more speaker .
i wish , in fact , to refer to two things mentioned by the commissioner for external relations in his speech .
the first thing he emphasised was that we must improve relations between europe and the islamic world .
we must develop more stable , more secure and more pluralistic countries in the middle east and around the mediterranean .
the second thing the commissioner said concerned the links between our financial support and behaviour at what he called grass roots level , that is to say how matters appear out in the cities , towns and villages when it comes to observing human rights .
i want to talk about a subject that is almost taboo from a political point of view . it concerns the interplay between religion and politics .
as the commissioner said , our relations with the islamic world are an extremely sensitive area , both internally in the european union and in our various member states .
i mean that religion and freedom of religion are of fundamental significance for the development of human rights and , ultimately , of democracy .
religion must not , of course , take over the political system , but nor can religious life be kept completely separate from the rest of society .
i believe that the types of solutions that exist in certain countries , for example in iran where an islamicist council of guardians says who may stand in elections and who may not , is completely unreasonable .
nor am i convinced that the french or turkish solution , in which religious symbols are to be banned in schools , is the right one .
i wish , therefore , to refer to what commissioner patten has said about our relations with the islamic world and about mr van den bos ’s report on human rights , adopted by parliament in july 0000 .
a number of amendments were approved , emphasising every person ’s right to seek their own faith , the right to change religion and the right not to belong to any religion .
the value of being free to conduct missionary work , irrespective of whether the country concerned is predominantly christian , muslim or jewish , was also emphasised .
the fundamental principles are that of the equal value of human beings , irrespective of religion , gender or ethnicity , the principle of non-discrimination and the principle whereby religion stands for non-violence , love and reconciliation .
the equal value of human beings , irrespective of their religious affiliation , is emphasised .
i believe that the conversation about the significance of religion for the good society and for combating the misuse of religion itself to issue threats , perpetrate violence and oppression and justify terrorism and discrimination against people is an important and fundamental part of our relations with the islamic mediterranean countries .
let the dialogue about religion and the good use of religion in the proper sense of the word be an important part of our relations with countries around the mediterranean .
mr president , the importance attached by the european parliament to respect for and the safeguarding of democracy and human rights everywhere and always is a known fact and is non-negotiable .
as a general principle , it has become our prime concern to demand the same respect and the same application from all our partners , without wrongful interpretation , differentiation or a selective approach .
in addition to this , our insistence on control of the application and operation of the principles of democracy , human rights , the rights of national minorities and sexual equality are uniform and undivided for everyone , everywhere .
the linking of european financial aid with compliance with absolute respect for the above rights is also uniform for everyone , everywhere .
this truth is repeated and emphasised in the relevant motion by the european parliament to our mediterranean partners , in order to avoid misunderstandings or different interpretations .
good accounts make good friends .
deepening political dialogue on issues of democracy and respect for human rights at all levels certainly helps to consolidate our bilateral relations and transactions and to further deepen them .
the exchange of information , knowledge and experience by all the partners , as the motion comments , helps to further serve the desired approach on the basis of principles and rules which are common to and respected by everyone .
the commission 's contacts with civil society and the reports on its findings to all the partners are a simple , straightforward tool for evaluating the present situation , to be praised , or an intervention to be corrected .
with the recent excellent upgrading of the mediterranean forum to parliamentary assembly , a huge step has been taken towards democratic dialogue and creative consultation and understanding between the partners on both sides of the mediterranean .
this political dialogue will help enormously to resolve possible problems or misunderstandings and to support the procedure of rapprochement and cooperation , which will serve stability and the peaceful development and coexistence of the entire mediterranean area .
let us hope that those developments in the israeli-palestinian dispute , which are still obstructing an unimpeded approach , come to an end as quickly as possible , without walls and divisions , for the good of the entire area and its inhabitants .
mr president , it is a fact that the countries of the south-eastern mediterranean and the middle east as a whole are an important field of action for the foreign relations of the european union and the present commission communication confirms this .
it is particularly positive that the commission recognises that the marginalisation of women undermines political representation and obstructs economic and social development in the area .
it is true that women in mediterranean and arab countries , despite a certain improvement in conditions over recent years , continue to be the victims of sexual discrimination and inequality .
illiteracy , poverty , domestic violence , inadequate medical and pharmaceutical care , little participation in professional and political life , these are the main features of the life of women on the southern shores of the mediterranean basin and in the countries of the middle east .
worst of all , however , is that women are the main victims of religious and political fundamentalism , <unk> and autocratic regimes which base their power to a large degree on controlling the sexual conduct of women , their way of life , their reproductive functions and even the way they dress .
certainly , the best defence against the powers of retrogression and intolerance is to strengthen the secular aspect of the state and the legal democratic order .
our message must be clear .
no political system , religious movement , tradition or custom can take precedence over respect for the fundamental freedoms of women , human rights and the rule of law .
the more these basic elements of a democratic state are missing from numerous countries of the mediterranean , the more the hopes for economic and social development and an improvement in the position of women will remain dim and the resolutions passed by the conferences held within the framework of the barcelona process will remain dead letter .
that is why we are asking the european commission and the representation of the euro-mediterranean parliamentary assembly to use all the mechanisms at its disposal in order to include clear clauses and commitments on the recognition and protection of human rights and the rights of women and the principles of the rule of law as for the development of the countries of the mediterranean and the elevation of the mediterranean basin to an area of peace and cooperation .
i do not want to delay the house unduly as it quietly prepares to go about its democratic duty . however , i should like to respond to one or two questions from what has been an important and useful debate .
i was asked how our proposals had been received by our partners .
the fairest diplomatic answer is that the ideas have been received rather cautiously in some countries but much more positively in others – jordan and morocco spring to mind .
whatever the response , the ideas that we have put forward are now a central part of the debate , a central part of the dialogue with these countries .
it is important to remember that what we are talking about is not negative conditionality , but positive encouragement .
we are talking about setting aside part of our meda funds each year and allocating them to those countries which enter into specific partnerships with us to develop democracy and human rights .
that is an important shift of emphasis and an important way of trying to use our development assistance and cooperation to promote political objectives which we all know are crucial , not only to the stability and wellbeing of societies , but also to their long-term economic development .
in pressing our views on issues such as human rights in tunisia – to which the honourable member rightly referred – we have to be vigorous and avoid being counterproductive .
a couple of weeks ago in another part of the world – when pressing the case for the rule of law and civil liberty – i was accused of being neo-colonial .
i had to point out that as far as i was concerned that was a terrible insult : i had been the real thing ; i had been a real colonial oppressor and not simply a neo-colonial <unk> .
we have to be careful about how we proceed with the debate .
it is also important to recognise that it is a long process and that , as mrs bonino said , we need to be consistent .
we need to show that we mean what we say .
we have to be mindful of our credibility and we have to make sure that this is a debate we conduct on the basis of mutual esteem , on the basis that we are on an equal footing .
i was also asked how our arguments and ideas tied in with those of the united states on democracy and the wider middle east .
it is fair to say that this is a subject about which we have a decade of experience .
we welcome the united states ' interest .
i am sure there will be a lot of discussions , as there were last weekend at the munich security conference .
i hope that we do not lose the distinctiveness of our own approach .
i hope that we do not lose sight of the fact that this is a long-term process and i hope that , as the honourable member said late in the debate , that we do not lose sight of the relevance of the middle east dispute , of the relationship between israel and palestine , to the discussion about democracy in the wider region , because at the moment undoubtedly some in the arab world doubt our credentials and goodwill because they do not think we are doing enough to resolve the problems of palestine .
lastly i would like to repeat again to mr mcmillan-scott that we go into these debates with an open mind .
we recognise the experience and the wisdom of parliament and we are sure that together parliament , commission and council will be able to frame a policy which will not only continue to command the attention of the whole house , but will actually lead to the sort of beneficial consequences that we wish to see .
thank you very much , mr patten , for your contribution and your efforts in a climate which has not always been very easy .
i have received motion for a resolution b0-0000 / 0000 , tabled pursuant to rule 00 ( 0 ) of the rules of procedure .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place today , thursday .
mr president , on a point of order under rule 0a and annex xi of the rules of procedure , i should like to ask the president if he would refer the events of this morning 's stoa management committee to the anti-fraud office for investigation .
the committee voted by 00 votes to 0 to suppress a scientific report on inedibles , in respect of which the european academy of sciences ' advisory committee stated : ' this report is , overall , a reasonable , impartial and balanced piece of work on a very difficult topic . '
the peer review would lead me to conclude that it should definitely be published .
it is important that the general public realise that this decision was made on the basis of grave political errors , rather than believing that the committee has become a <unk> property of european chocolate manufacturers .
we will forward your comment to the president , mr ford . ( 0 )
we shall now proceed to the vote .
( 0 )
given the importance of the aims of the media programme , we broadly welcome the report and the extension until 0000 requested by the commission .
like the rapporteur , however , we regret that there is , as yet , no definitive report that evaluates the programme ’s implementation .
we trust that parliament will shortly be provided with this .
a high-quality , wide-ranging debate must be held regarding audiovisual policy at european level , before decisions can be made regarding the bases of any future programme .
it is , therefore , also important that all elements in the audiovisual sector – namely , operators , various networks and associations – as well as workers and representatives from the general public , will be invited to participate in this debate .
as we all know , media plus and media-training programmes constitute one of the pillars of europe ’s audiovisual policy .
these form the community support mechanism for the audiovisual sector and replace the media i and media ii programmes , which were launched , respectively , in 0000 and 0000 .
experience acquired in the previous programmes has helped considerably to improve the functioning of the current media instruments .
media-training aims to support study on the application of the new technologies ; economic , commercial and financial management ; techniques for the financing , production and distribution of audiovisual programmes ; techniques for the development of new audiovisual programme types and <unk> and <unk> techniques .
in addition to the establishment of a dedicated parliamentary committee , i also welcome the commission ’s intention to ensure , for 0000 , that continuity is provided to operators and professionals who are involved in the media-training programme , which would therefore be extended without any structural changes until 00 december , with increased funding .
encouraged by the parliamentary committee ’s unanimous approval for the proposals to establish a training programme for professionals in the european audiovisual programmes , i voted in favour .
i have voted in support of this report welcoming the extension of the european maritime safety agency 's powers to maritime security and seafarers ' qualifications .
parliament is perfectly correct to emphasise the need to make maritime transport safer , better protect the marine environment and enhance shipping security .
in the wake of the disaster and the many other catastrophes we have witnessed we can all agree that maritime transport must be made a lot safer and there must be far better coordination of actions in all member states .
a properly resourced european maritime safety agency would enable such coordination with due respect for the need to safeguard the subsidiarity principle in recognition that primary responsibility must lie with coastal member states .
i also fully support the proposal that the european maritime safety agency should be involved in recognition of certificates of competency for seafarers and hope that the agency will prioritise this particular area with a view to ensuring greater safety for workers and citizens .
it is however my view that emsa should not be given responsibilities for combating terrorism : these must continue to be the responsibility of the member states , and i welcome the clarifications contained in the report in this regard .
i congratulate mr mastorakis on his report , which i wholeheartedly welcome .
i should like to highlight two points that i consider to be of great importance :
- complete support for extending the competences of the european maritime safety agency to include the fight against pollution .
there are major advantages in coordinated community action in this area and the agency can play a crucial role , by integrating mechanisms that will make cleaning-up operations more effective following oil spills ;
- agreement that the agency will be able to intervene in matters of security , as a result of the new tasks assigned by the member states through the directive on ‘ ships and port facility security ’ .
regulation no 0000/0000 , establishing a european maritime safety agency , was adopted by parliament and the council on 00 june 0000 and came into force following its publication in the official journal in august 0000 .
the main task of this new body will be to provide technical and scientific assistance to member states and the commission in order to ensure that community legislation in the maritime navigation sector is correctly implemented , to prevent ship-source pollution and to monitor the implementation of this legislation .
following the recent series of disasters at sea , the commission proposes extending the competences of the agency to provide it with the necessary means to address certain problems connected with maritime safety .
most importantly , it assigns complementary tasks to the agency to support the commission ’s activities in the fight against terrorist acts on ships and port facilities , in training seafarers and in the fight against marine pollution .
there is already a legislative framework in place that establishes a system of cooperation in the area of sea pollution , and a community mechanism designed to encourage closer cooperation in emergency interventions in the field of civil protection .
this proposal , which has undergone substantial improvement in the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , wins my support .
mr mastorakis ’ report deserves our wholehearted support .
the european maritime safety agency must have the competences and the means to prevent and combat pollution caused by ships and other vessels .
we must ensure that the agency is located in portugal and – in the interests of decentralisation and of combating the inherent imbalance in portugal ’s <unk> development – we must make it possible for the agency , or one of its branches , to be located in <unk> , on the algarve , in southern europe .
the sustainable development of transport requires the adoption of an integrated approach to transport that exploits to the full the potential of all the different modes currently available .
bearing this in mind , the commission has pointed out the difficulties encountered by users of current intermodal loading units ( <unk> ) – in other words , containers or boxes usually used in transport – which range from the diversity of handling and securing devices to questions of security and methods of monitoring .
the aim of this proposal is to recommend the use of an optional european <unk> ( <unk> ) that will overcome such difficulties by combining the benefits of both swap boxes and containers , which could be used in rail , road , sea and river transport .
this measure will provide the transport sector with the freedom to opt for the alternative proposed by the commission , which will undoubtedly bring advantages .
i welcome the method chosen to promote the new system , which remains non-mandatory for member states , granting financial benefits and other incentives to encourage community projects or programmes that clearly demonstrate the intention of using <unk> .
in view of the potential benefits for commercial transport , i voted in favour .
. we can only take pleasure in the new protocol raising the capacity of the international oil pollution compensation fund ( iopcf ) to eur 000 million .
i have therefore voted in favour of the gil-robles gil-delgado report .
however , we cannot ignore the fact that the damage caused by the sinking of the is estimated at a minimum of eur 0 billion .
in view of the size of oil tankers , and therefore the scale of the disasters they may cause , we are far from our target .
this is why it seems to me necessary to progressively raise the ceiling for iopcf compensation , and that we need an additional fund amongst the european states , provided that it is not used as a pretext to postpone the necessary adaptation of the iopcf .
we must also adopt international agreements which are not limited to establishing the responsibility of the owner of the vessel , as is the case today , but also extend responsibilities to all the actors in the transport chain , ship operators , charterers , and also owners of the cargo transported , thereby encouraging the latter to take care to choose safe ships .
i wish to confirm my support for this report authorising austria and luxembourg to sign the 0000 protocol by 00 june 0000 .
i believe that in response to the accident involving the there is a clear need to ensure that full and swift payments can be made to victims of future oil spills , notwithstanding our obligation to do everything possible to prevent such incidents from happening in the future .
i call on all member states to sign , ratify or accede to the protocol as soon as possible .
. i voted for this report because it is important to make the current system for compensating victims more efficient .
additional funds should allow for effective , quick and fair compensation for victims of future oil spills .
this is why the member states must sign or ratify the protocol on this fund as quickly as possible .
i would like to express some reservations however .
first of all , it is unacceptable that the human , economic and environmental damage resulting from the sinking of the is not taken into account in the raising of compensation .
furthermore , it is a shame to be deprived of recourse to the cope fund , a european additional compensation fund with a ceiling of eur one billion , since it could have speeded up the compensation of victims who were not in a position to obtain complete compensation within the framework of the international system .
this dossier , which has been left aside , seems to be mistaken for the additional fund .
finally , the member states must transpose the measures adopted at european and international level following the and accidents as soon as possible .
in conclusion , i would point out the equally important need to act in advance by means of a genuine preventive policy .
polluters must be severely punished and each party involved in the transport of goods must be made responsible .
. we voted in favour of this report , as we feel that the new supplementary fund will greatly help to ensure that victims of future oil spills will be paid in full and more swiftly .
this proposal arose following the council ’s decision authorising member states to sign or ratify , in the interest of the european community , the protocol of 0000 to the international convention on the establishment of an international fund for compensation of oil pollution damage , 0000 .
the international maritime organisation ( imo ) protocol increases the funding available to compensate the victims of oil spills .
the member states have been called on to sign this protocol as soon as possible and , if possible , by 00 june 0000 .
this decision follows the accident involving the in november 0000 , when the council adopted a firmer position on the need for additional compensation . more recently , the european council of 00 march 0000 confirmed the point of view expressed at various council meetings , calling on member states , ‘ in terms of compensation for the victims of pollution , including environmental damage ( ... ) to pursue within the forthcoming diplomatic conference at the imo in may an increase in the current ceiling on compensation to eur one billion ’ .
on 00 may 0000 , the imo adopted a new protocol to the existing oil pollution liability and compensation conventions . this protocol establishes a supplementary fund , which multiplies the ceiling by five ...
. i congratulate mr gil-robles on his recommendation on the establishment of an international fund for compensation of oil pollution damage .
i share his opinion that maximum levels of compensation in this fund are insufficient to guarantee adequate protection for victims of any future large-scale oil spill .
the supplementary fund will compensate victims provided that compensation claims are deemed justified and if the person is unable to obtain full and adequate compensation under the 0000 fund convention .
i should also like to point out that raising the level of compensation can be no excuse for negligence in terms of prevention .
. the proposal for a decision submitted for parliament ’s approval , authorises and calls on member states to accede to the protocol on the international maritime organisation ( imo ) compensation fund , which increases funding available to compensate the victims of oil spills .
by significantly raising the ceilings for compensation established by the existing international system , the protocol on the supplementary fund plugs one of the most important gaps in international regulations on oil pollution liability .
the new supplementary fund will ensure that victims of spills of harmful substances will be paid swiftly and in full , thereby providing against situations such as the and the .
given that some parts of the protocol on the supplementary fund fall within the exclusive competence of the community , member states must ratify it in order to comply with the protocol , thereby leading to implementation , which will naturally enjoy the support of our vote in favour .
. the proposal for a decision submitted for parliament ’s approval authorises member states to accede to the protocol on the international maritime organisation ( imo ) ’s supplementary fund , which increases the funding available to compensate victims of oil spills .
member states are requested to sign this protocol as soon as possible .
the protocol establishes an international fund for compensation of oil pollution damage , 0000 , to ensure that victims of damage caused by oil spills from tankers will be paid compensation swiftly and in full .
by raising the compensation ceiling established in the existing international system , the protocol plugs one of the most important gaps in international regulations in terms of liability for oil pollution , as the compensation ceiling set by the supplementary fund will be fixed .
there will probably be far fewer parties to the new fund than to the 0000 fund , since numerous states that were party to the 0000 fund feel that there is no need for supplementary protection .
i believe that the new fund will greatly help to ensure the full and swift payment of victims of oil spills .
i voted in favour .
. the extremely precarious state of the metallurgy sector is well known , as is the lack of an overall plan to revive the sector at european level .
portugal has also suffered as a result of this .
hence our vote in solidarity with the workers , the unions and the population of terni , in the hope of maintaining a high-tech production hub .
we deplore the rejection of our group ’s proposal , which was intended substantially to diminish the effects of company relocations , from which portugal is also suffering .
it is therefore essential that the commission propose adequate legislation to protect workers from the appalling consequences of company relocation , that it promote legislation containing social clauses designed to protect jobs and the standard of living of families affected , and which commit companies to providing workers with the opportunity to gain new professional qualifications .
a new policy is also required that would oblige multinationals , especially those that neglect their social responsibilities , to return any financial support granted to them .
i wish to support this call on the commission and the member states to learn lessons from the europe 's largest corporate scandal in years , and strengthen eu auditing rules with particular regard to the interest of workers .
in the wake of the accounting scandal surrounding italian food group parmalat , which erupted in december 0000 with the revelation of a black hole of eur 0 billion in lost funds and eur 00 billion in unpaid debt , i believe we certainly need the commission to set up a revised directive on corporate governance that could strengthen rules on auditing .
time and time again workers and pensioners have lost out in the wake of corporate scandals so none of us can be in any doubt that there is an urgent need to improve corporate governance and strengthen our defences against corporate malpractice .
good company law and good corporate governance are essential to the job security of all employees and to the protect the future of members of company pension schemes .
the financial services industry must certainly put its house in order and ensure ethical conduct and diligence to protect the jobs and savings of millions of people .
it is outrageous that no warning signals were sounded while parmalat funds were being embezzled .
. – the parmalat company has been presented to us as an example of the success of liberal globalisation .
parmalat , once a small family pasteurised milk company , was developed partly thanks to european union subsidies .
since 0000 , it had multiplied its subsidiaries and created shell companies in tax havens .
the system lasted until 00 november 0000 , when the auditors expressed doubts about a eur 000 million investment in the cayman islands .
parmalat – like enron , <unk> , world com or <unk> – is nothing but a prototype for this rogue capitalism .
for 00 years , parmalat ’s bosses have received public subsidies , disguised their accounts and announced fictitious profits .
these practices have led to the elimination of thousands of jobs .
however , the resolution proposed does not attack these mafia practices and confines itself too much to observations .
it is for these reasons that we have abstained .
first of all , the eu should do everything possible to ensure that all the people responsible are extradited and tried quickly .
then , the eu must stop giving public subsidies to this type of company .
furthermore , employees and their organisations must have the means for effective control of accounts .
finally , all tax havens in the eu ( san marino , monaco , luxembourg , and others ) must be eliminated .
. – at the end of yesterday ’s debate , commissioner bolkestein neglected the two key problems : legal tax havens and the impact of fraud on employees and small savers .
it is good that he is introducing strict disclosure requirements in september , which will result in special operations and transactions being listed in the accounts and the use of special instruments being explained ; that should have been done much sooner .
it is imperative that we have an accounting system that does not conceal the actual state of affairs and the reasons for it .
what i now find the most worrying is that european countries are offering companies the opportunity of bypassing rules laid down by other countries .
i had always thought that the problems of banking secrecy , <unk> companies and tax havens were confined to luxembourg , austria and the swiss cantons <unk> and <unk> , but it now emerges that thousands of billions of parmalat ’s property was kept in the netherlands with the help of 000 trust offices , five private companies and one foundation .
the favourable investment climate for foreign companies created by the dutch government in the 0000s gives swindlers and tax evaders <unk> .
i have not heard anything from the dutch commissioner about what action he is taking against this policy , which his party helped to promote .
i shall shortly be putting this on the agenda , therefore , in questions to the european commission .
. i welcome this report on approximating civil procedural law in the eu , aimed at harmonising the entire body of private international law relating to contractual obligations .
i agree with the rapporteur that in this field it is preferable for the provisions concerned to be directly applicable in all member states instead of being subjected to the uncertainties stemming from the transposition of a directive . the future instrument should therefore be adopted in the form of a regulation .
i also agree with the rapporteur , with regard to the proposal for an order for payment procedure , when he underlines that the approximation of civil procedural law in the eu cannot happen unless the system of notification and communication of judicial and extrajudicial acts must be standardised . i also endorse his view that , in the small claims procedure , alternative ways of resolving cases should be found that may make it possible to simplify the taking of evidence and to limit the right of appeal .
i welcome the rapporteur ’s suggestions to ensure that the powers granted to the court of justice in this field are not excessive .
i voted in favour .
we agree with the demand that the guantánamo bay prisoners should receive a fair trial . that is why we have voted in favour of this report .
we believe , however , that it is not clear that the prisoners fulfil the conditions for being regarded as prisoners of war under the geneva convention .
the report is not , therefore , correct in invoking the rules of the geneva convention on the treatment of captured soldiers as rights possessed by the guantánamo bay prisoners .
. events in afghanistan have been a cause for serious concern for a number of years .
the world must not forget the afghan people , who continue to suffer from the impact of wars waged by those who value their economic and geo-strategic interests ahead of people ’s well being .
the taliban regime was appalling .
equally appalling , however , was the war started by the us administration , under the pretext of combating terrorism .
more than two years on , it is clear that the war did not solve the underlying problems of the afghan people , nor did it help to support the country ’s move towards democracy .
as the report says , ‘ the deteriorating security situation is the main threat to the population of afghanistan and to the efforts of afghan and international ngos supporting reconstruction , rehabilitation and development initiatives and to the peace process in general ’ .
events today in afghanistan , and indeed in iraq , clearly demonstrate the complete mistake of going to war .
the bush administration should be condemned for the appalling situation in these countries and for the terrible suffering of the majority of the population .
. – there is a great difference between the reality within afghanistan and the way it is regarded by outsiders .
it is a collection of isolated valleys , with different languages and cultures , that have little more in common than their muslim religion , the oppression of women , and the fact that they were herded together into a single state in the 00th century in order to form a neutral buffer zone between the british and russian spheres of influence .
although <unk> , uzbeks and <unk> also live in neighbouring countries , the issue of whether their languages should be prohibited within afghanistan is being discussed as part of the establishment of the afghan constitution .
the outside world is imposing a supreme president and a central army on the country with the task of achieving unity , whereas , in practice , the president and the army do not have any power outside the capital .
this kind of illusion of unity will induce the outside world to retain a permanent military presence in the struggle against peoples who have no desire for such unity .
the only possibility of a lasting peace seems to lie in a <unk> constitution consisting of cantons with a high degree of autonomy and different languages .
i welcome the indication the proposed text gives that the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy is starting to understand something of this and is advocating decentralisation , a stronger parliament and an independent judicial system .
i can only support the proposal in the absence of the amendments by the group of the european people ’s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats which seek to move away from these .
. i welcome this report on the situation in afghanistan .
the reality is that the recent history of the country is characterised by a lack of security and by the slow pace of reconstruction , a situation that makes it essential for the eu to adopt positions .
i agree with the rapporteur that concern must be expressed with regard to the difficult situation facing women in afghanistan .
the eu must insist that improving the situation of women represents a priority for the country .
it is true that some progress has been made , such as the ratification of the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women by the afghan transitional authority ( ata ) and the reference to equal treatment for women and men in the new constitution adopted on 0 january .
while these are important steps , they are insufficient in themselves . it is essential that the ata condemn consistently , publicly and unequivocally all acts of violence perpetrated against women and children .
i endorse the rapporteur ’s view that funds from the community budget earmarked for the ata must be increased , particularly because granting less money may be seen as a lack of support for the progress that has taken place and as a disincentive to proceed with reconstruction .
the idea of creating a european reconstruction agency along the lines of the kosovo model must be considered .
that concludes the voting .
– mr president , i would like to point out that someone has just been taking photographs from up there , with the evident intention of discrediting a lady mep .
i ask that the photographer should have his camera taken off him and the pictures confiscated .
i will ask the services to do what they can , mr gröner . ( 0 )
the sitting is resumed .
the minutes of yesterday ’s sitting have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
– mr president , i just wanted to say that mr hans-peter martin has announced the withdrawal of the report on lobbying in industry because of his own personal interest .
this is not something that the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy welcomes ; it has been done contrary to the intentions of the relevant committee and of the coordinator .
i just wanted to have it recorded in the minutes of the house that he personally withdrew this report contrary to the intentions of the relevant committee and contrary to the statement that he made .
– mr president , i just wanted to say that i hope – as i trust mr rübig does too – that this report can be discussed in plenary as soon as possible , as it certainly should be .
we take note of the comments made for the minutes .
the next item is the debate on the oral question ( b0-0000 / 0000 ) by mr herzog , on behalf of the confederal group of the european united left/nordic green left , to the commission , on the european commission 's strategy on services of general interest ( sgi ) .
– mr president , commissioner , we are extremely concerned about the commission ’s strategy in relation to services of general interest .
first of all , we condemn the lack of transparency , and also of respect , towards civil society and parliament .
in fact , in relation to services of general interest , the commission has carried out consultations throughout 0000 , but they were separate consultations .
the competition dg has produced a package on financial compensations , which i only know about through journalists , and essentially these texts completely ignore the advice and requests of our parliament .
financial compensation is essential to the very existence of services of general interest .
any intrusion by the commission in the field of definitions and rules justifying compensations would be unacceptable , since it is outside of its competences .
the commission ’s role is to apply the law , not make it .
another reason for parliament ’s call for a legal act under codecision which would include the principles of funding is to clarify the treaties and case-law .
in this regard , only codecision would allow us to achieve a legitimate and viable compromise .
therefore , in the white paper , which it must publish before april , the commission must give a clear ‘ yes ’ or ‘ no ’ to this demand for a legislative act .
by saying ‘ no ’ , by not responding clearly and by assuming the right to impose substantial definitions and rules , it would be committing an abuse of power .
for the moment , on the basis of the information available to me , i note that , in the package under preparation , it assumes it has the power to lay down rules , and that many of these choices formally contradict the european parliament ’s resolution .
the resolution we adopted on 00 january of this year states that ' the task at community level for services of general interest is to guarantee their exercise within the internal market and , notably , to ensure that competition rules are compatible with public service obligations ' .
but i believe that the monti package , which i have not seen , makes funding possibilities more difficult , in the name of full respect for competition rules .
i would insist , under these circumstances , and we have already told you this – i remember in particular the speeches by mr langen and mrs flautre , last year – on the fact that we do not want a new communication on the interpretation of the treaty and jurisprudence .
we want the commission to prepare a legislative act involving the codecision procedure .
however , the commission is competent in the field of the application of rules .
it is therefore entitled to prepare a decision and a framework , but these executive acts depend , as we all know , on the interpretation of rules .
that is why we are asking you to say explicitly today , when you have corrected them following consultation , that these texts under preparation will only enter into force provisionally , while we await the adoption of a legislative act .
i would now like to draw your attention to the substance of the monti proposals , which contradict our resolution .
far from increasing legal certainty , they will worsen the uncertainty .
many services of general economic interest , in particular social , which did not previously notify , would now have to notify .
for the acceptance of compensation , the requirements for tendering procedures will be toughened up .
our requests for criteria for the calculation of costs are being ignored .
the notion of over-compensation would be greatly extended .
as for services provided essentially to companies , they would be considered not to be included in the notion of service of general economic interest , which would represent a blatant intrusion into the field of definitions .
so here are my questions .
what is the commission ’s timetable for action ?
will you respond coherently to the consultation and the proposals on compensations in the white paper that we asked you to present here in april ?
will you state clearly yes or no to a legal act through codecision ?
will you state that your executive texts are of a provisional nature while we await the adoption of the corresponding legal act ?
. mr president , i would like to say what a pleasure it is to be here this afternoon .
with several hours of further debates ahead of me , i will have been able to spend the whole day in the hemicycle , and what more could a man want – except perhaps to be lying on a beach in <unk> ?!
the honourable member raises some extremely important issues , and i will come to some of the points he raised in a moment .
i recognise that his question suggests that there is still some confusion about the commission 's intentions .
so i want at the outset to state as clearly as i can that the commission does not intend to adopt any final package before drawing political conclusions from the broad public consultation on the green paper on services of general interest .
the commission services have assessed very carefully the responses received with regard to the financing of services of general interest .
the responses are various and interesting , and i can , if parliament would like , refer to some of them .
the public consultation has clearly confirmed the need to increase legal certainty and clarity with regard to the application of the state aid rules in this area .
in fact the comments received from interested parties and also the discussion on the green paper in parliament have both shown that there is a broad agreement that such a clarification is not only necessary , but is also urgent .
a decision exempting certain types of aid from the notification obligation would be , in our judgment , an appropriate instrument for achieving more legal certainty .
given the urgent need for clarification the commission is considering extending the consultation started by the green paper to the specific aspect of financial compensations for public service obligations .
this could be done by submitting appropriate proposals for consultation .
in conclusion , i re-emphasise that the commission will not draw any definitive conclusions in the area of services of general economic interest before it has presented its conclusions on the consultation on the green paper , which it intends to submit during the month of april , which is exactly what parliament has requested .
– mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to start at the end .
parliament has resolved to demand the creation of a legal framework under the codecision procedure and while respecting the principle of subsidiarity in connection with the implementation of the provisions on the internal market and competition and in relation to the compatibility of competition and the internal market with services of general interest .
we have called upon the commission to present , by april at the latest – and we now hear that it will take all the time it has been given – a follow-up document , in which it will show what it has learned from the consultations on the green paper and make it clear where it stands on the possibility of a legal framework and what it proposes to do next .
that is our position where codecision , subsidiarity and adequate provision for services of general interest are concerned , and we will not accept anything to the contrary .
secondly , we are so overwhelmingly in favour of the codecision procedure not only because it increases our influence , but also because services of general interest are a quite crucial issue for the public in terms of european politics , and because we want to do everything we can to prevent the public thinking of liberalisation , competition and the internal market as being in conflict with services of general interest and security of provision , and , instead , to try to get the two to work together .
we affirm that social cohesion is not excluded by competition , liberalisation and the internal market , but is , on the contrary , dependent on them and needs complementary measures .
that is why the way we handle services of general interest is closely tied in with public confidence in our policies on competition and the internal market and in europe ’s competences – and that is why we , the public ’s representatives in the citizens ’ parliament , who have to deal with this permanent antithesis on a daily basis , want to be involved in deciding and determining what is to be done .
my next point is that it is important that the principle of subsidiarity be maintained in view of the differences involved – differences in definition from one member state to another , differences in geographical situations , differences in the problems of demographics and those affecting social and health policy .
that is another reason why we are so strongly in favour of the european constitution , because the draft contained a formulation securing the principle of subsidiarity , one to which we can give our support .
there is something else i would like to touch on . according to the constitution , the european union ’s goal is the social market economy and social cohesion .
treating services of general interest as not being the antithesis of competition and the internal market is what defines and gives life to the governing principle of the social market economy and creates social cohesion on that basis .
i stress the need both for potential service providers to be treated impartially and for there to be security of provision , the latter of which must be ensured even if aid payments are needed to do so .
the fact is that we need services of general interest only where the market is unable to guarantee these services on a universal basis , at affordable prices and to a high standard of quality .
mr president , commissioner , i have to admit that i prefer to discuss foreign policy with you , because that is where your heart lies .
the fact is , though , that you have to take this opportunity too .
what i did not like about the statement you had to deliver , i think , was its failure to acknowledge that the present european social model is supported by a majority of this house .
a narrow majority perhaps , but still a majority .
i believe it is also supported by the majority of the european population , who see services of general interest as something different from the other goods and services that are on offer .
i believe that the basis for any consideration of services of general interest is the identification of the specific interests of the general public , and here i am certainly at one with mr karas .
in contrast to many other services , people can also help to determine , by the way they vote in elections , the range of services of general interest available to them , especially if these services are provided by or on behalf of regional or local authorities .
people want sufficient high-quality public services at a reasonable price .
the market may well be an instrument with which this aim can be achieved – i certainly do not rule that out – if its activity is governed by proper guidelines .
the basic guidelines would therefore have to be set by means of a legal act adopted jointly by the council and parliament .
that goes without saying , in my view , and the commission must surely agree .
